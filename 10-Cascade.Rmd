# CASCADE

The Cascade Tab allows DataPack users to view and set the overall contour of their treatment and testing program across both geography and population. Of all tabs in the COP23 Target Setting Tool, this tab experienced the most changes compared to the COP22 DataPack, reflecting changes in PEPFAR COP guidance to reemphasize the importance of Viral Load Testing Coverage (VLC) in the HIV response.

As seen in Section 7 of PEPFAR COP/ROP 2023 Guidance, Country Teams are asked to center their COP23 discussions around the concept of Population Viral Load Suppression (PopVLS), or the percent of all People Living with HIV who have a suppressed viral load. This metric provides a succinct, composite view of the HIV response, including: new infections, testing & diagnosis, linkage to and retention on treatment, eligibility for viral load testing, roll out of viral load testing, and viral load suppression.

Because this is a fundamental shift in the Cascade tab from previous years, it is important to have an overall understanding of the flow of the Cascade calculations from FY23 estimated PLHIV to the TX_PVLS and TX_NEW targets. This logical flow is described in the figure below. The key assumption is the "Planned PopVLS rate (FY23)", which takes you from the FY23 estimated PLHIV to the measured number of virally suppressed patients in the OU (VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23)). This use of the term % PopVLS should be distinguished from its use in other settings where it is meant to convey the theoretical fraction of PLHIV who are virally suppressed (whether in-care or out of care, tested for viral load or not). As used in the DataPack, PopVLS is a programmatic PopVLS that conveys only what can be measured either by the host country or by PEPFAR. The VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) is then multiplied by the Planned PEPFAR Contribution to the HIV Response (FY23) to give the PEPFAR TX_PVLS (N) (FY23) target. The PEPFAR TX_PVLS_D is then divided by the Planned VLS Rate (FY23) to yield the TX_PVLS (D) (FY23) target.

The DataPack then calculates the TX_NEW target from the TX_PVLS (D) target. Because TX_PVLS (D) is only the number of persons on treatment tested for VL, the DataPack calculates the total number eligible for VL testing by dividing by the Planned VLT Coverage (FY23). The number eligible for viral load testing can be thought of as the sum of those who were already on treatment, i.e. TX_CURR (FY23), and those who are initiated on treatment during FY23 and eligible for VLT. To get the number of persons initiated on treatment (whether eligible for VLT or not), we divide by the Planned % Recently Initiated on ART Eligible for VLT (FY23). The number initiated on treatment during FY23 is similar to TX_NEW, but still may contain individuals who may have previously been on ART, fallen out of care, and re-initiated treatment who may not need to be retested for HIV and who should not be included in TX_NEW. Therefore, we calculate the \# of previous infections who are treatment naïve by multiplying the total number of previous infections by the % Prev. Infections Initiated on ART who are Treatment Naïve. TX_NEW is then calculated as the sum of previous infections who are treatment naïve and the new infections initiated on ART.

As in past DataPacks, this tab interweaves with many other tabs of the DataPack, including the PMTCT, TB, EID, VMMC, KP, HTS, CXCA, HTS_RECENT, and TX_TB_PREV tabs. As is explained below and in sections related to these tabs, DataPack logic is most useful when target-setting begins in the Cascade tab and progresses from left to right, both within that tab, and across and within all other tabs, returning iteratively to the Cascade tab throughout.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Cascade from PLHIV to TX_NEW Target and Relationship to Datapack Assumptions.png")
```


## TX_CURR (FY24), PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Observed) & PEPFAR FY23 Cascade (Planned)
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "TX_CURR (FY24)"
columns <- col_seq("F", "F")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Observed)"
columns <- col_seq("G", "K")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "PEPFAR FY23 Cascade (Planned)"
columns <- col_seq("L", "R")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

The first column of the Cascade, column F, introduces a long requested change to the Target Setting Tool. The column for whether TX_CURR Target derived by OU analysis. This column gives teams the ability to enter a FY24 TX_CURR Target that has been dtermined through external analysis or modeling can be entered into this column. If teams enter target values into this column, this target will take precedent to be the TX_CURR FY24 target that will be used as the target that is imported into DATIM in the ART Section (please see that section for more details). 

This section provides an overview of PEPFAR FY22 results and FY23 targets, both to give insight into the current status of PEPFAR's contribution to the host country HIV response, as well to serve as reference to many other sections in the Cascade tab. Review this section to understand PEPFAR's trends for the following data, as well as the linkages and relationships between them:

-   New Positives --- including from both HTS_TST_POS (serologic testing) & PMTCT_HEI_POS (virologic testing)

-   TX_NEW

-   TX_CURR

-   TX_PVLS (D)

-   TX_PVLS (N)

-   In the Cascade-PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Planned) section we have added a new column based on feedback gathered in the retrospective process. The TX_CURR: Expected Achievement (FY23) has been added to default to be the larger of the TX_CURR FY22 Result or the TX_CURR FY23 Target. This column is editable for teams to indicate what the expected achievement for FY23 will be. The value in this column is the TX_CURR (FY23) that will be referenced in the ART Modeling and ART sections as well as subsequent sections of the Cascade tab.

## Host Country Context

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "Host Country Cascade (from Spectrum tab, or manually entered here)"
columns <- col_seq("S", "AH")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data, max_col = 4)) {
  make_table(t, section)
}
```

For those leveraging UNAIDS Spectrum estimate exports for the Data Pack, once these have been loaded into the Spectrum tab of the Data Pack, this first portion of the Cascade tab will automatically update to reflect these estimates. For those leveraging alternatives to Spectrum, see below.

In specific, the Host Country Context section of the Cascade tab provides space for reflecting the following data:

-   **Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22)** $TX\_CURR\_SUBNAT.R$: Observed/actual total number of PLHIV receiving ART as of September 2022.

-   **Host Country Projected PLHIV (FY24)** $PLHIV.T$: Porjected PLHIV from sum of Host Country PLHIV Diagnosed (FY23) and  Host Country Projected New Infections (FY24).


\**Note:* This indicator is not available via Spectrum for COP23. If high quality data is available from another source, you may enter it this here, overwriting formulas, though retain data source documentation. However, if data is not readily available, it is best to leave this column blank --- the DataPack was designed to populate subsequent columns even without this data.

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section, replacing any preexisting estimates for these indicators that may have already been entered in DATIM:

-   **Host Country Estimated Population (FY23)** $POP\_EST.T\_1$
-   **Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY23)** $PLHIV.T\_1$
-   **Host Country Estimated HIV Prevalence (FY23) (%)** $HIV\_PREV.T\_1$
-   **Host Country PLHIV Diagnosed (FY23)** $DIAGNOSED\_SUBNAT.T\_1$
-   **Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22)** $TX\_CURR\_SUBNAT.R$
-   **Host Country Estimated TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY23)** $TX\_CURR_SUBNAT.T\_1$
-   **Host Country Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY23)** $VL\_TESTING\_SUBNAT.T\_1$
-   **Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY23)** $VL\_SUPPRESSED.T\_1$

### Instructions

1.  If using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data:

    a.  Review the above columns to confirm that data has been correctly linked with the Spectrum tab. You may consider using filter drop-down menus to quickly inspect for any non-numeric, negative, or invalid data.

    b.  Review Relative Standard Error values to identify any estimates with a Relative Standard Error of more than or equal to 20. See the section below for additional instructions.

2.  If leveraging alternatives to UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data, see the below section.

3.  Confirm that no data has been entered against \_Military Organization Units. See below for more explanation.

Please note that the Host Country Estimated Patients Tested for VLS (FY23) and the Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY23) are not available from Spectrum/Naomi. Therefore, they will not populate from the Spectrum tab. The DataPack does not need it populated to work, and if it is left blank the DataPack will rely on PEPFAR MER data.

### Leveraging Alternatives to Spectrum

Most countries are encouraged to use UNAIDS Spectrum as their source for the above data. However, Country Teams may request approval from their PPM and a DUIT Liaison to use an alternative data source if deemed more reliable.

In this case, paste estimates from other approved sources into this section of the Cascade tab by overwriting the formulas currently in these green columns. Due to hidden Relative Standard Error columns between the various estimate columns, it is recommended you paste this data in one column at a time, rather than in bulk. It may also reduce technical issues to first copy geographic data in the SNU1, PSNU, Age, and Sex columns into a separate spreadsheet, then use Excel lookup functions to add estimates data against the correct geographies and populations, and then return to pasting data into the original Cascade tab column by column.

Please note that it is not required to populate the Host Country Estimated Patients Tested for VLS (FY23) and the Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY23) columns. In fact, in the absence of appropriate programmatic or clinical data, it is inadvisable to expend great effort on making these estimates. The DataPack has been redesigned with the understanding that most countries will not have these data. If these columns are left blank, the DataPack will automatically use PEPFAR program data to estimate the Working PopVLS Rate and the cascade calculations will still be able to proceed.

### Relative Standard Errors

UNAIDS Spectrum estimates are accompanied by Relative Standard Errors (RSE) for each data point, both at the District level as well as the Age/Sex-specific level. These indicate the relative reliability of each of these data, which should be considered when using these to make program planning decisions.

Along with the data points above, RSEs will also automatically be populated in the Cascade tab from data loaded into the Spectrum tab. While initially these RSE columns will be hidden, you can unhide these columns to inspect these values. RSEs are also used to color-coded related columns based on the relative uncertainty of each specific data point as follows:

-   **Red:** RSE $\geq$ 40.

-   **Yellow:** RSE \< 40, but $\geq$ 20.

-   **Green:** RSE \< 20.

Red or yellow highlighting may not always mean a data point should be disregarded, nor is it the case that all green values should be taken at face value. Either way, consider these RSEs as helpful guideposts in interpreting the contextual meaning and quality of UNAIDS Spectrum estimates.

If, in reviewing Relative Standard Error values, the uncertainty interval of an estimate appears to be concerning, consider the following next steps:

1.  Raise and discuss the issue with your PPM and DUIT Liaison.

2.  Communicate concerns to assigned UNAIDS liaisons and discuss appropriate methods for improving or better understanding data quality for the data points in question.

### Host Country Estimates for Military Organization Units

Due to issues of political sensitivity and national security, estimates for the above indicators should not be entered against Military Organization Units. Any case where this does occur will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App, and removed during DATIM import.

  }
```

This section of the Cascade tab builds upon the preceding Host Country Context and PEPFAR Cascade sections to arrive at an analysis of gap to PopVLS by geography and population. This analysis for popVLS, helps the DataPack user simulate the percentage of PLHIV who are virally suppressed, either from Host Country or PEPFAR data, which derives downstream PEPFAR cascade indicators beginning with TX_PVLS.

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23)** $VL\_SUPPRESSED.T$

### Instructions

1.  Review historic PEPFAR and Host Country data to understand existing trends by geography and population.

2.  Review the estimated PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response for FY23, and adjust the planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response for FY23. See below.

3.  Review baseline Working PopVLS Rate for FY23. This is estimated from Host Country PLHIV estimates and either Host Country VLS data, if available, or extrapolated from PEPFAR VLS data otherwise.

4.  Review and adjust the Planned PopVLS Rate for FY23. See below for additional information

5.  Review resulting **VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT**. See below for additional information.

### PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response

While PEPFAR's contribution to the HIV response within the Host Country may vary across areas of that response, this column attempts to summarize this contribution for use in modeling subsequent targets.

The DataPack first attempts to describe PEPFAR's contribution during FY23, based on both Host Country estimates as well as PEPFAR Results and Targets. Keep in mind as you review these data that the methodologies used in producing Host Country estimates may produce artificial discrepancies between PEPFAR and Host Country values. For example, if Host Country estimates are produced from household surveys, these residential-centric data may differ significantly from PEPFAR's data, which are largely collected at point of service. (Because of this, it is recommended that Host Country estimates follow a point-of-service model where possible.)

In the following column, adjust values to reflect PEPFAR's planned contribution to the HIV response. Keep in mind that if PEPFAR's FY22 results or FY23 targets are greater than Host Country Estimates for a given geography of population, it may be wise to maintain this same relationship to avoid depressing treatment and testing values set later in the Cascade tab beyond what would be the result of projected retention rates.

### Working & Planned PopVLS Rates

One of the most pivotal assumptions in the DataPack is the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23). In planning your PopVLS rate, you should consider your OU's current status in this age-sex-PSNU stratum as represented in the Working PopVLS Rate (FY23) column and your OU's ambitious but feasible aspiration for expansion of VLC. It is important to understand that the DataPack does not require you to estimate the Host Country FY23 PopVLS. Host Country columns may be left blank and the DataPack will estimate Working PopVLS from the imported MER data. To calculate the estimated --- or, Working --- PopVLS Rate for FY23 (i.e., projected as of September 2022), the Data Pack may use a variety data points, depending on data availability for a given geography and population.

In all cases, the denominator of this calculation is the estimated PLHIV, making it critical that this data be added to the Data Pack in the Host Country Context section.

For its numerator, the DataPack first attempts to use Host Country estimates of the total number of Virally Suppressed ART Patients ($VL\_SUPPRESSED.T\_1$):

$$
\frac{Host\ Country\ Est.\ Virally\ Suppressed\ ART\ Patients\ (FY23)}{Host\ Country\ Est.\ PLHIV\ (FY23)}
$$

However, when Host Country estimates of the number of virally suppressed ART patients are unavailable, the DataPack refers instead to PEPFAR data for TX_PVLS (N) either from FY23 targets or, if these are also unavailable, FY22 results, and then extrapolates these to the Host Country context by referencing the Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response set previously.

$$
\frac{PEPFAR\ TX\_ PVLS}{Host\ Country\ Est.\ PLHIV\ (FY23)}
$$

Reviewing and understanding the Working PopVLS Rate arrived at in this column is critical for much of the rest of the DataPack. In particular, this column is immediately used to inform the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23) in the next column. While the default in this column is 95% x 95% x 95%, reflecting the UNAIDS "95 for All" goals, anytime the Working PopVLS Rate from FY23 is higher than this default for a given geography/population, the higher number will be used instead. The gap between the FY23 Planned and FY23 Working PopVLS Rates is instrumental in determining the following key data points throughout the remainder of the Cascade Tab:

-   Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT

-   PEPFAR TX_PVLS (N)

-   PEPFAR TX_PVLS (D)

-   PEPFAR TX_NEW

-   PEPFAR TX_CURR

-   PEPFAR TX_CURR_SUBNAT

-   PEPFAR HTS_TST totals

No matter the starting default for Planned PopVLS rate, you may adjust this target to fit the realities of your country context and your treatment program. It may also be helpful to return to this column to iteratively adjust it as you proceed through the next few sections of the DataPack. To help conceptualize how you might adjust the planned PopVLS Rate, please review the figure in the introduction of this section which describes the role of the Planned PopVLS Rate assumption in the overall logic of calculating the TX_PVLS and TX_NEW targets. As described in the introduction, Planned PopVLS is not intended to convey the idea of population viral load suppression as used in some other settings to mean the theoretical fraction of the PLHIV population that is virally suppressed (whether in care or out of care, tested or untested). Rather, it is best thought of as a programmatic PopVLS value that summarizes the relationship between PLHIV and the clinically known and measured number of virally suppressed PLHIV on treatment.

Because the single Planned PopVLS number is multiplied by the PLHIV estimate to yield the targeted national number of virally suppressed persons (Viral_Suppression_SUBNAT), it should take into account all intermediate steps, i.e. the % diagnosed, % linked to ART, % eligible for viral load testing, % tested for viral load, and % virally suppressed. The calculations in this figure may also be written out as the following formula:

$$
{Planned\_PopVLS}\ =\ {\%\ Diagnosed\ in\ Full\ Population} \times \\
{\%\ Linked\ Among\ All\ Diagnosed} \times \\
{Proportion\ of\ full\ FY23\ TX\_CURR\ Eligible\ for\ VLT} \times \\
{Planned\ VLT\ Coverage\ (FY23)} \times {Planned\ VLS\ Rate\ (FY23)}
$$

Of the factors included in the Planned PopVLS formula, Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Responses (FY23), Planned VLT Coverage (FY23) and Planned VLS Rate (FY23) are present as such in the DataPack. However, percent diagnosed in the full population may be different from the DataPack assumption column "Planned % New Infections Diagnosed (FY23)", which is applied to new (FY23) infections only.

Percent linked among all diagnosed may similarly be different from the DataPack assumption column "Targeted Linkage Rate (FY23)", which in the DataPack is only applied to persons diagnosed in FY23.

Finally, the proportion of the full FY23 TX_CURR eligible for VLT relates to the entire FY23 treatment cohort, whereas the DataPack assumption of Planned % Recently Initiated on ART Eligible for VLT (FY23) with default of 70% only applies to those initiated on ART in FY23; the proportion eligible in the full treatment cohort will be substantially higher and can be calculated by assuming that 100% of the FY23 treatment cohort are eligible for viral load and taking a weighted average of the percentages as follows:

$$
\frac{{Total\ Initiated\ on\ ART\ (FY23)}  \times
{Planned\ \%\ Recently\ Initiated\ on\ ART\ Eligible\ for\ VLT\ (FY23)} + \ {(100\ \%\ *\ TX\_CURR\ Target\ (FY23))}}{{Total\ Initiated\ \ on\ ART\ (FY23)} + {TX\_CURR \ Target \ (FY23)}}
$$

Because the DataPack calculates viral load testing, treatment, and testing targets by first setting the measured number of virally suppressed persons (VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT $$FY23$$) using the Planned PopVLS Rate and then stepping back up the cascade, if the Planned PopVLS Rate and these other assumptions are not internally consistent, then the DataPack may give unexpected results, such as setting targets above the PLHIV estimate. Having an understanding of the relationship between the Planned PopVLS and its component assumptions may help teams troubleshoot the DataPack if it seems to be setting inappropriate targets.

It is noteworthy that in cases where the host country estimates of viral suppression are derived from population-based surveys of viral load that get around incomplete programmatic viral load testing, but programmatic viral load coverage in the country is low, the use of these host country estimates to calculated planned PopVLS without adjustment for VLC may give unexpected results. Unless reliable programmatic Host Country VL data is available, it may be best to leave the columns for H.C. Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY23) and H.C. Est. Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY23) blank, and then the DataPack will automatically rely on PEPFAR PVLS data including TX_PVLS_N, which represents viral suppression only among those tested for viral load, i.e. it incorporates the level of viral load coverage in the OU.

NOTE: The Data Pack will not prevent situations resulting in PopVLS Rate exceeding 100% in a given PSNU, but will flag these cases in Red to highlight when it occurs. Given that these may be a common occurrence in cases of urban PSNUs, they are allowable in the Data Pack, though should be coordinated with PPMs and DUIT Liaisons.

### VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT

VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) is set as follows (rounded to the nearest integer):

$$
{Planned\ PopVLS\ Rate\ (FY23)}\ \times \ ({PLHIV\ (FY23)}\ +\ {Projected New Infections (FY23)})
$$

As is evident here, targeted VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT is set as a function of FY23 estimated PLHIV plus the New Infections projected for FY23. How these projected New Infections specifically impact PEPFAR targets for TX_NEW, HTS_TST_POS, and TX_CURR will be explained in subsequent sections.

### \_Military Organization Units

Due to sensitivities around PopVLS estimates for Military organization units and populations, this data will not be reflected here in the Data Pack. Country Teams should coordinate closely with Department of Defense liaisons who will perform a similar analysis based on available data sources and then directly paste resulting TX_PVLS (N) targets against the Military organization unit, overwriting the formulas in the TX_PVLS (N) column described in the next section.

For cells that are labeled with "\*For DOD Military Use Only", in OU DataPacks that do not have Military targets, these cells can be overwritten with zero (0). If they are left with the "\*For DOD Military Use Only", they will be dropped upon import.

## TX_PVLS (N)

**TX_PVLS (N):** Number of ART patients with suppressed VL results (\<1,000 copies/mL) documented in the medical or laboratory results/LIS within the past 12 months.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "TX_PVLS (N)"
columns <- col_seq("AU", "AW")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_PVLS (N): Routine (FY23)** $TX\_PVLS.N.Routine.T$

### Instructions

1.  Filter out both \<01 year olds and \_Military organization units. See below for additional steps for these groups.

2.  Review FY23 TX_PVLS (N) Routine targets. To make initial adjustments, return to the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23), Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response (FY23), New Infections (FY23), and PLHIV (FY23). However, at this stage, it is recommended to leave defaults for these in place and review modeled targets for TX_PVLS (N), TX_PVLS (D), TX_NEW, and TX_CURR, paying special attention to TX_NET_NEW (FY23), which will be explained further in the TX_CURR section below.

3.  Unfilter \_Military organization units and coordinate with DOD SI so they can paste TX_PVLS (N) targets here. In doing so, they may need to adjust targets in other PSNUs as well. See below for additional information.

### TX_PVLS (N): Routine (FY23)

For both TX_PVLS (N) and TX_PVLS (D), targets are set in the Data Pack only for Routine viral load testing.

TX_PVLS (N) targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer:

$$
{TX\_ PVLS.N.Routine}_{t}\  = \ {VL\_SUPPRESSION\_SUBNAT}_{t}\  \times \\
\text{Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response (FY23)}
$$

### \_Military Organization Units

Due to the sensitive nature of DOD support for foreign government Military organization units, DOD SI teams model and set PSNU-level targets for TX_PVLS (N) separately so they can leverage granular data collected in their protected systems. DOD SI liaisons have authority to overwrite formulas so as to paste targets for Military organization units in the TX_PVLS (N) column of the Data Pack. As needed, they also have permission to coordinate with other interagency representatives to adjust assumptions and targets in other organization units in order to accommodate \_Military organization unit targets, which are effectively a cross-section subset of targets across all other PSNUs.

### Infants Virally Suppressed

Targets for \<01 year olds who are virally suppressed are set and modeled separately from all other age groups as an extension of the PMTCT model used on the PMTCT tab of the Data Pack. These are initially set without sex disaggregation on the EID tab of the Data Pack, then equally allocated by male and female to be reflected on the Cascade Tab. As such, it is recommended that \<01 year olds be filtered out while working through the remaining sections of this Cascade tab, and reviewed here in the Cascade Tab only once targets on the PMTCT and EID tabs have been fully reviewed.

## TX_PVLS (D)

**TX_PVLS (D):** Number of ART patients with a Viral Load (VL) result documented in the medical or laboratory records/laboratory information system (LIS) within the past 12 months.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "TX_PVLS (D)"
columns <- col_seq("AM", "AO")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY23)** $TX\_PVLS.D.Routine.T$

### Instructions

1.  In preparation for setting assumptions for the FY23 Planned VLS Rate, review Host Country estimates and PEPFAR results and targets for trends in VLS rates for each PSNU and population. This can be done in the Data Pack in this section, as well as in PAW, DATIM, and Panorama. Yellow highlights in these columns indicate where VLS rates have historically been below the UNAIDS goal of 95%, and red highlights indicate where reported data produces VLS rates above 100%.

2.  Review and adjust the FY23 Planned VLS Rate. This defaults to 95%, unless historic Host Country or PEPFAR data shows a higher trend. However, you may adjust these as needed. In many cases, it is recommended to leave modeled assumptions in place and review targets through to the TX_CURR section of this tab, paying special attention to TX_NET_NEW, and then return to this and other assumptions to adjust iteratively.

3.  Review TX_PVLS (D) targets for routine viral load testing. See below for additional information.

### TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY23)

As mentioned above, only Routine Viral Load testing will be targeted in the Data Pack. Within the Data Pack, TX_PVLS (D) targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer:

$$
{TX\_ PVLS.D.Routine}_{t}\  = \ \frac{{TX\_ PVLS.N.Routine}_{t}}{{Planned\ VLS\ Rate\ (FY23)}}
$$

## VLT Coverage

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "VLT Coverage"
columns <- col_seq("AV", "BL")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data, max_col = 4)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

No Targets will be imported to DATIM from this section.

### Instructions

1.  Filter to exclude \<01 year olds.
2.  In preparation for setting targets for **diagnosis rates** for both New Infections and those previously Undiagnosed, review historic Host Country estimates of the percent of PLHIV with known HIV Status, and the number of PLHIV who were previously Undiagnosed. Yellow highlights indicate where diagnosis rates appear to be lower than the UNAIDS goal of 95%.
3.  Review and adjust the P**lanned Percent of New Infections to be Diagnosed in FY23**. Return to the projected New Infections (FY23) column in the Host Country Context section of this tab to add or adjust New Infections and Incidence Rates as needed. Planned diagnosis rates here default to 95%, unless historic Host Country trends have been higher. In either case, you may adjust this assumption as appropriate.
4.  Review historic data about diagnosis rates, and adjust the **FY23 Targeted Linkage Rate**, which applies both to New Infections and those Previously Infected who are not yet on ART including Undiagnosed and those Previously Diagnosed but not on ART). Note that Linkage Rates set here are *also* applied to the models used on the PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs in order to maintain linkages between TX_NEW, PMTCT_ART, TB_ART, and VMMC testing's linkage to treatment.
5.  Adjust the **Percent of Recently Initiated on ART who are planned to be Eligible for VLT during FY23**. Keep in mind that per MER guidance, individuals must have been on ART for at least 3 months to be eligible for VLT. As such, the default in this column is 70%, though can be adjusted as needed. Also note that this eligibility rate applies to all those planned to be initiated on ART during FY23, whether treatment naive (New Infections, Previously Undiagnosed, or Previously Diagnosed), or those Returning to Treatment.
6.  Review historic data about VLT coverage, and adjust the **FY23 Planned VLT Coverage Rate**. This rate defaults to 95%, though can be adjusted with approval from Chair.
7.  Coordinate with DOD SI Liaisons to paste targets for **FY23 New Infections Initiated on ART**, overwriting formulas as needed, and adjusting upstream assumptions for other organization units as needed to reflect the cross-section of DOD targets.
8.  Review FY23 targets modeled for **New Infections Initiated on ART**, **Previous Infections to be Initiated on ART**, and the **Total Initiated on ART**. See below for additional detail.
9.  Review targets for the FY23 planned **Total Eligible for VLT**. See below for additional detail.
10. Review the **FY23 Final Planned VLT Coverage**, which may differ from planned VLT Coverage Rates set in the steps above. Discrepancies can be traced to assumptions set earlier for the PopVLS Rate, the PEPFAR Contribution to the Host Country HIV Response, Diagnosis Rates, Linkage Rates, and Eligibility Rates.

### New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)

Based on Incidence Rates and projected New Infections modeled in the Host Country Context section of this tab, this section of the Data Pack models how PEPFAR will support identifying these individuals and linking them to ART. As such, FY23 New Infections Initiated on ART is set as follows, reflecting both diagnosis and linkage to ART:

$$
{New\ Infections\ Initiated\ on\ ART}\ =\ {Projected\ New\ Infections\ (FY23)} \times \\
{Planned \ PEPFAR\ Contribution\ to\ HIV\ Response\ (FY23) \ (\%)} \times \\
{Planned\ \%\ New\ Infetcions\ Diagnosed\ (FY23)\ (\%)} \times \\ {Targeted\ Linkage\ Rate\ (FY23)\ (\%)}
$$

Keep in mind that targets for infants to be initiated on ART, as mentioned above, are set on the EID tab and only reflected here. Also similar to the above, targets for new infections to be initiated on ART in \_Military organization units are set and modeled separately by DOD SI liaisons, and will be pasted here in this column.

### Previous Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)

After setting the Planned PopVLS Rate and other assumptions earlier (see above section on Working and Planned PopVLS Rate), the Data Pack calculates both TX_PVLS (N) and TX_PVLS (D) targets.

Subsequently, the Data Pack looks to calculate the total newly eligible for VLT in FY23 (Note this is not a column in the COP23 Data Pack but is part of the equation within the column that estimates the Previous Infections Initiated on ART (FY23). Since the exact number of individuals that will be eligible for viral load testing in FY23 is unknown, the data pack gives us the assumption that all those planned to be on ART at the end of FY23 are eligible for VLT in FY23, therefore:

$$
{\text VLT\_NET\_NEW } = \frac {TX \_PVLS \_D \ (FY23)}{Planned \ VLT \ Coverage \ (FY23)} \ -\ {TX \_CURR \ (FY23)}
$$

The full equation for estimating Previous Infections Initiated on ART is:

$$
\frac {VLT \_NET \_NEW}{Planned \ \% \ Recently \ Initiated \ on 
 \ ART \ Eligible \ for \ VLT \ (FY23)} \ -\\ {New \ Infections \ Initiated \ on \ ART \ (FY23)}
$$

This is a remainder calculation, in that the data pack assumes all those planned to be on ART at the end of COP23 were eligible for VLT in FY23, then estimates those that are planned to be eligible in FY23, and subtracts them first via those New Infections to be Initiated on ART and Eligible for VLT. Then, if VLT_NET_NEW remains, the Data Pack assumes the remainder must be filled by initiating on ART those that had been previously infected by otherwise not on ART. Also note, that in cases where PopVLS Rates lead to a negative VLT_NET_NEW, this remainder is prevented from ever being below zero.

### Total Eligible for VLT (FY23)

The total Eligible for VLT is based first on the total number of individuals in the incoming treatment pool (TX_CURR from the previous year's targets), and secondly on the total number of individuals to be Initiated on TX_CURR who are projected to be on ART within the first three quarters of the Fiscal Year.

$$
{PEPFAR\ Total\ EVLT\ (FY23)}\ =\ {(Total\ Initiated\ on\ ART\ (FY23)} \times \\
{Planned \ \%\ Recently\ Initiated\ on\ ART\ Eliglible\ for\ VLT\ (FY23) \ (\%))} + \\
{FY23\ TX\_CURR\ (Planned\ TX\_CURR\ Result\ for\ FY23)}
$$

This formula assumes all those who are targeted in COP21 to be on treatment at the end of FY23 are eligible for VLT in FY23 and a % of those that are initiated on ART in FY23 are eligible for ART. See step 5 in the instructions above for how review and modify this assumption.

## TX_NEW

**TX_NEW:** Number of adults and children newly enrolled on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). $Part 1 of 2$

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "TX_NEW"
columns <- col_seq("BM", "BN")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_NEW (FY23)** $TX\_NEW.T$

### Instructions

1.  Return to the VLT Coverage section to review assumptions and targets related to **New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)**, **Previous Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)**, and **Total Initiated on ART (FY23)**. Keep in mind that TX_NEW encompasses both those New Infections Initiated on ART, as well as those previously infected initiated on ART who are treatment naive (as opposed to those who returning to treatment).

2.  Review and adjust assumptions for the **Percent of Previous Infections Initiated on ART who are Treatment Naive (FY23)**. The default for this column is 100% (i.e., none of those previous infections to be initiated on treatment in FY23 are returning to treatment), though you can adjust this column as appropriate for your context.

3.  Review **FY23 TX_NEW** targets and return to previous steps to adjust assumptions and modeling decisions as necessary. See below for additional information.

4.  Again, it is recommended that you filter out infant populations, as these are set separately on the EID tab, and focus on other populations at first. Only once you have confirmed targets for \<01 year olds on the EID tab, return to review those targets on the Cascade tab alongside other populations.

### TX_NEW

Because MER guidance stipulates that TX_NEW is to be used for reporting initiation on ART of those who are treatment naive, TX_NEW may not always be the same as the target for the Total Initiated on ART (FY23) set in the VLT Coverage section previously due to portions of the total number initiated that may be comprised of individuals who are returning to treatment.

## TX_CURR

**TX_CURR:** Number of adults and children currently receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART).

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "TX_CURR"
columns <- col_seq("BO", "BS")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_CURR (FY23)** $TX\_CURR.T$

### Instructions

1.  Review and adjust assumptions for **Targeted Retention Rates**, both for those Initiated on ART during FY23, and those Already on ART at the start of FY23. The default for each of these is 98%, though you may adjust these as needed.

2.  Return to the PEPFAR FY23 Targets Cascade section to review the **incoming Treatment Cohort**, which often times comprises the bulk of TX_CURR targets set in this section.

3.  Return to the VLT Coverage section to review targets for the **Total Initiated on ART (FY23)**.

4.  Review targets for **TX_CURR (FY23)**, which is based on the incoming Treatment Cohort, the Total Initiated on ART (FY23), and related retention rates for each.

5.  Review historic TX_NET_NEW planned during the previous COP, as well as targeted TX_NET_NEW resulting from targets modeled in this Data Pack for the upcoming Fiscal Year. In some cases, negative TX_NET_NEW may result, and may not necessarily indicate quality failure, but will be highlighted red to encourage intentional discussion about these cases. It may be necessary to return to previous sections at this point to adjust assumptions. This review and adjustment process may be iterative, and may also depend on targets set in the PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs as well.

## TX_CURR_SUBNAT

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "TX_CURR_SUBNAT"
columns <- col_seq("BT", "BV")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY23)** $TX\_CURR\_SUBNAT.T$

### Instructions

1.  Return and review assumptions for the **PEPFAR Contribution to Host Country HIV Response (FY23)** set previously in the VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT section of this tab.
2.  Return and review PEPFAR targets for **TX_CURR (FY23)**.
3.  Targets for **TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY23)** are set in this section by extrapolating PEPFAR TX_CURR targets to a broader context based on PEPFAR's planned contribution to the Host Country HIV Response (FY23).
4.  Review the **historic estimated Population ART Coverage** (the total on ART, divided by the total PLHIV).
5.  Review the **Planned Population ART Coverage** for the upcoming Fiscal Year, based on all the targets set to this point. As needed, return to previous sections to adjust assumptions in order to influence this column, especially assumptions related to TX_CURR and TX_CURR_SUBNAT.

## PEPFAR Testing

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "Testing"
columns <- col_seq("BW", "CI")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data, max_col = 4)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

There are no Targets from this section that will be imported into DATIM.

### Instructions

1.  As explained above, TX_NEW includes both those who are newly infected, as well as those who had been previously living with HIV, but who had never been linked to ART. Among this second cohort, one portion may have been previously undiagnosed, while another previously diagnosed but not on ART. In this section, review and adjust assumptions to indicate what percent of those previously living with HIV had been **Previously Diagnosed**, as opposed to **New Diagnoses**.

2.  Review historic trends from FY23 targets for the **Percent of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX**, and determine how to adjust this percentage for FY23 targets.

3.  Review total testing targets (**HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS**) for FY23. Where necessary, return to previous assumptions and adjust appropriately.

4.  Review FY23 targets for **HTS_INDEX Positive** and adjust the Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTX_INDEX for FY23 as necessary.

5.  Review FY23 targets for **PMTCT_STAT New Positives** and **HTS_TST Post ANC1 New Positives** and navigate to the PMTCT tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary.

6.  Review FY23 targets for **TB_STAT New Positives** and navigate to the TB tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary.

7.  Review FY23 targets for **VMMC_CIRC Tested Positives** and navigate to the VMMC tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary.

8.  Review FY23 targets for **PMTCT_HEI_POS** and navigate to the EID tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. For infants under 1 year old, 100% of testing targets should come through PMTCT_HEI_POS. See below for additional information.

9.  Review FY23 targets for **HTS_TST_POS from All Other Modalities** and navigate to the HTS tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary.

10. Review percentage contributions toward FY23 targeted Total Positives from HTS_INDEX, PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC, PMTCT_HEI_POS, and All Other Modalities. Red highlights across these columns indicate cases where targets have been over- or under-distributed across modalities. See below for additional information about reconciling discrepancies among these modalities.

### Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX

Unlike in past years, the COP23 Data Pack initially sets the percentage of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX based on the percentage used in the previous year's targets, but allows adjustments from this beginning rate as needed.

### Testing Rationalization

As testing targets are set in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, and EID tabs, these will be reflected here on the Cascade tab to reconcile against those high-level testing targets set following the logic flow in preceding sections. This section of the Cascade tab can serve as a Table of Contents across these tabs as you adjust assumptions and reconcile targets. Similar Testing Rationalization sections also exist in each of these tabs for easier reference.

Red highlighting will indicate any case where over- or under-distribution of testing targets across testing modalities has occurred. As these issues arise, determine whether to adjust either TX_NEW or total Testing targets, or related targets in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, or EID tabs.

After testing targets have been allocated to PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, and PMTCT_HEI_POS, any remainder will be available for further allocation against other testing modalities in the HTS tab of the Data Pack.

### Testing Targets for Infant Populations

Similar to other targets for \<01 year olds seen on the Cascade Tab, targets for infants identified as HIV-positive are initially set in the EID tab, without sex disaggregation. In reflecting these in the Cascade tab, these values are equally allocated across male and female infants.

Per COP Guidance, 100% of these testing targets for infant populations should be accommodated for via PMTCT_HEI_POS, and no other modality. Should any portion of these targets be allocated to any other modality, an alert will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App. Conditional formatting within the Data Pack will also indicate when this has occurred.

## Testing Reference Distribution

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "Testing Reference Distribution"
columns <- col_seq("CJ", "CP")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data, max_col = 4)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

No Targets from this section will be imported into DATIM.

### Instructions

1.  Review this section for any cases where targets may be over- or under-allocated across modalities, which will be highlighted red for easy distinction.
2.  Return to the previous section to review target values as needed, or navigate to the PMTCT, TB, EID, or VMMC tabs to adjust targets set on these tabs.

## HTS_Index

**HTS_INDEX:** Number of individuals who were identified and tested using Index testing services and received their results

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "HTS_INDEX"
columns <- col_seq("CQ", "CX")

data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data, max_col = 4)) {
  make_table(t, section)
}
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **COMMUNITY - Contacts Tested, New Positive** $HTS\_INDEX\_COM.New.Pos.T$

-   **COMMUNITY - Contacts Tested, New Negative** $HTS\_INDEX\_COM.New.Neg.T$

-   **FACILITY - Contacts Tested, New Positive** $HTS\_INDEX\_FAC.New.Pos.T$

-   **FACILITY - Contacts Tested, New Negative** $HTS\_INDEX\_FAC.New.Neg.T$

### Instructions

1.  Review the estimated percent of total HTS_INDEX positives to be identified in **Community Sites**. This will initially be pre-populated based on historic trends as recorded in DATIM, but may be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%, or under 0%.

2.  Review estimated **yields** among HTS_INDEX contacts newly tested, both for Community and Facility sites. These are initially pre-populated based on historic trends from DATIM, but can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%, or under 0%; yellow highlights indicate cases where yield rates are less than 20% for 15+ year olds.

3.  Review modeled targets for the following columns. See below for additional information:

    a.  COMMUNITY -- Contacts Tested, New Positive

    b.  COMMUNITY -- Contacts Tested, New Negative

    c.  FACILITY-- Contacts Tested, New Positive

    d.  FACILITY-- Contacts Tested, New Negative

4.  Review the Actual percent of HTS_TST_POS to come from Index testing, calculated by dividing the sum of Community and Facility HTS_INDEX_POS by the total HTS_TST_POS.

### HTS_INDEX Disaggregates

In general, HTS_INDEX disaggregates across both Community and Facility sites, and across both Negative and Positive HIV test results, are set by combining HTS_INDEX_POS with the percentages set in steps 1 and 2 above.

Targets for HTS_INDEX New Positives in Community Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

$$
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}\  = \ {HTS\_ INDEX.Pos}_{t}\  \times \\
{\%\ HTS\_ INDEX\_ POS\ identified\ in\ Community\ Sites}_{t}
$$

Building from this, targets for HTS_INDEX New Negatives in Community Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

$$
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Neg}_{t}\  = \ \frac{{HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}}{\text{Community New Tested Yield}_{t}}\  - \\
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}
$$

Alternatively, targets for HTS_INDEX New Positives in Facility Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

$$
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}\  = \ {HTS\_ INDEX\_ POS}_{t}\  - \\
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}
$$

And finally, targets for HTS_INDEX New Negatives in Community Sites are set as follows: $$
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Neg}_{t}\  = \ \frac{{HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}}{\text{Facility New Tested Yield}_{t}}\  - \\
{HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}
$$

## DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT

```{r, cascade_diagnosedsubnat, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Cascade"
section <- "DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT"
columns <- "CY"

data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
}
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **Host Country DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT (FY23)** $DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.T$

### Instructions

1.  Return to the VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT section to review the **planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response**.

2.  Review FY23 targets for **Host Country DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT**. This is based on the PEPFAR target for Total Testing, but extrapolated to the Host Country context following the planned PEPFAR Contribution to the HIV Response, then added to the estimated FY23 DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT indicated in the Host Country Context section of the Data Pack.
