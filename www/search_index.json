The following pages aim to provide users of the DataPack with the information necessary to successfully complete each tab of the DataPack tool and determine accurate, data-driven targets. For the past several years, the DataPack has a been a key element of PEPFAR COP planning, and for COP22 serves a critical function in assisting PEPFAR Country Teams in setting targets in line with the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals for Testing, Care &amp; Treatment, PMTCT, VMMC, OVC, and other program areas. Please note that the COP22 DataPack is mandatory and must be used to set targets for COP22. For COP22, all indicators included in the DataPack are MER 2.6 indicators. For further information on the MER 2.6 indicators, please go to https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200929315-MER. 1.1 About the DataPack The COP22 DataPack supports analysis for all targets by Priority Subnational Unit (PSNU), population, and Implementing Mechanism (IM). This tool supports calculation of targets based on expected treatment coverage rates by type of PSNU and population prioritization: Attained Scale-up: Aggressive Scale-up: Saturation Sustained Prioritizations for PSNUs are arebased on COP Guidance section 7.3.2.ba. These determine for a given PSNU programmatically what HIV treatment and prevention services should be planned and informs both the overall strategy and the targets. Teams must review and revise their PSNU prioritization levels for COP22. The COP22 DataPack assumes a test and start treatment platform and will develop targets for achieving 95% coverage in Scale up: Aggressive and Scale-up: Saturation PSNUs; all other targets in the DataPack are based on the treatment targets, insofar as the treatment targets are the main focus of reaching epidemic control, and therefore relate to both testing and prevention targets. The DataPack will allow PEPFAR teams to use country specific programmatic assumptions to develop the optimum targets by PSNU along the program cascades to ensure the necessary number of PLHIV are diagnosed, linked, and start treatment. The DataPack does not necessarily calculate targets for every indicator, but it has space for teams to enter targets for all indicators and thus can be used to record agreed-upon COP targets, even for non-calculated indicators. Teams must not modify the structure of the COP22 DataPack in any way. The Office of the US Global Aids Coordinator (OGAC) has developed a process by which targets can be directly imported into DATIM via the DataPack Site Tool in order to generate targets. However, this is only possible for teams that do not in any way alter the structure or format of the DataPack. Additional details are provided in COP Guidance and will be available through COP webinars. 1.2 Highlighted Changes from COP21 to COP22 The COP22 DataPack is largely the same as the COP21 DataPack. However, please note the following updates that have been implemented as a result of multiple feedback sessions with various country teams that had been identified by the PRIME team, as well as new programmatic changes that are reflected in the Section 7 of COP guidance. These changes revolve around workflow, ease of target setting, and linkage to the COP guidance based on different aspects of the DataPack that worked well and others that did not during COP21 target stetting: New Cascade Approach that will flow from Program Viral Load Suppression to testing to allow for countries closer or at Epi Control to more easily set targets, based on Section 7 of COP22 Guidance. Integration of new SNS Modalities for HTS and HTS_Recent. Targets will no longer be set for PrEP_CURR, but instead will be set for a replacement indicator of PrEP_CT. 50+ finer age bands across the clinical cascade. These will be aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR. PSNUxIM tab structure that will again handle de-duplication and IM allocation. 1.3 Data Flow and Review Process to COP22 Submission The results from APR20 have been taken from DATIM and used to populate the DataPack. In turn, the DataPack targets will produce FY22 targets that will be subsequently submitted through DATIM after COP22 has been finalized and the PSNU level data entered into the Strategic Direction Summary (SDS) tables, where appropriate (Target related data). DataPack Review Single OU Track: Group 1 Single OU Track: Group 2 Single OU Track: Group 3 OUs at Epi Control Regional/ Country Pair Track 1st Draft Tool Submission Feb 28 Mar 7 Mar 14 Mar 7 or Mar 14 Feb 28 COP Meeting Mar 7-11 Mar 14-18 Mar 22-25 Mar 14-18 or Mar 22-25 Mar 22-25 Mid-point Tool Check Tools Due for Final Review Apr 4 Apr 11 Apr 18 Apr 11 or Apr 18 Apr 18 Additional Touchpoints/ Reviews Rolling Each Monday Tools Submitted for Upload to Apr 11 Apr 18 Apr 25 Apr 18 or Apr 23 Apr 25 COP21 Submission Due Apr 19 Apr 22 Apr 29 Apr 22 or Apr 29 Apr 29 Submission Process For each of the below submissions, the following process will occur: Country Teamspre-validates their DataPack submission in the DataPack Self-Service App (available at https://apps.datim.org/datapack/). Country Team uses DataPack Self-Service App to sync data with PAW Dossiers. Country Team saves DataPack to SharePoint under the OUs HQ Collaboration &gt; COP 2022 - FY 2023 &gt; Guidance, Tools, and Resources folder. Country Team submits a ticket in ZenDesk that includes: A link to the DataPack file saved in SharePoint Confirmation that this file has been pre-validated in the DataPack Self-Service App Confirmation that this file has been sent to PAW via the DataPack Self-Service App In copy: Chair, PPM, assigned DUIT Liaison, and any Interagency members that should be aware of ongoing review and discussions. Once this ticket is received, the DataPack Support Team will confirm all the above has occurred and send additional instructions as needed The PPM reviews the ticket/email thread and confirms the correct individuals have all been copied. The assigned PPM and the assigned DUIT Liaison use both the DataPack Self-Service App and the PAW COP Dossiers to validate and review the DataPack, noting any feedback in the ticket/email thread. The assigned Chair should also review all feedback on the ticket thread and any additional comments as needed. As is possible, all the above should occur within a 24 hour turnaround from the initial submission of a DataPack from a Country Team. While this process will remain the same for each submission for review, the content of each review will differ, as explained below. Once a Zendesk ticket and email thread has been started with an initial DataPack submission, all future DataPack submissions related to the same Country should use the same thread/ticket to allow for easy coordination. Submission 1 Validate high-level strategic planning direction aligns with the vision set by the PLL. Highlight any areas for technical assistance. Ensure construction of DataPack has not been tampered with. For this stage of review, it is not expected that your PSNUxIM tab be completed or even populated. At this stage, the focus should be on ensuring the high-level cascade is strategically aligned, and only afterward proceeding to allocating targets to IMs. Note that this is also partly to avoid Excel performance issues that may occur with the addition of more data to the PSNUxIM tab. Submission 2 Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during your first submission. Confirm no discrepancies between targets modeled in your submitted DataPack and any COP Meeting presentations to date or other high-level discussions had with PPMs and Chairs. Review the PSNUxIM tab and address issues related to IM and DSD-TA allocation, and deduplication. Submission 3 Again confirm DataPack alignment with all high-level decisions and any final presentations given by the Country Team. Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during the second submission. Track down and resolve any last bugs and issues in seen in the DataPack Confirm the DataPack is as near final as possible Final Submission Confirm all targets modeled in the DataPack are ready for submission to DATIM. Secure Interagency Government sign-off for import of your submitted DataPack to DATIM. Note authority to waive any lingering validation issues flagged by the DataPack Self-Service App. Once approval by PPMs, Chairs, and Liaisons is documented on the Zendesk thread/ticket, the DataPack Support Team will move forward with uploading your submitted DataPack to DATIM, then note completion of this here on this ticket. Once this is done, it is recommended that you review your data in DATIM to ensure alignment between DATIM and your DataPack. Please note in addition to these regular formal submissions, we encourage regular sharing and dialogue with Chair, PPM, and DUIT Liaison around target setting process generally, and DataPack specifically. Feel free to share draft versions as often as is helpful. 1.4 DataPack SharePoint Location The DataPack will be posted on PEPFAR SharePoint: www.pepfar.net. The file path will be OU &gt; Country Name &gt; HQ Collaboration &gt; COP 2022  FY2023 &gt; Guidance, Tools, and Resources. The file name will be Datapack_CountryName_20220108. 1.5 Tab Categories Each DataPack will start with 21 tabs organized in the order presented below. Upon downloading the DataPack, the PSNUxIM tab will appear as a blank sheet, but will be generated by the self-service validation app after you submit your preliminary DataPack.

Each section of the guide will list what columns users can expect to have data prepopulated and / or where they can enter data themselves. ENTERING DATA IN THE WRONG SECTION If you enter data into a cell that you are not supposed to enter data into, you will receive the following message box with corrective action suggestions as well. Example: 1.9 Adjustments to Historic Targets and Results Throughout the DataPack, historic targets and results have been provided for reference and often to drive target modeling algorithms. If, in the process of reviewing these historic data, issues with the data are discovered that may need to be addressed in DATIM, follow the below procedure: Raise specific issues with historic data to your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Determine together whether any issue identified requires updating values in DATIM. It maybe that together with your PPM and DUIT Liaison you decide that changes to historic values are not necessary in DATIM, but still necessary in the DataPack. This is an extraordinary circumstance and must have approval from PRIME/DUIT leadership via your Liaison to allow. If approved, you may make changes directly in the related column of the DataPack. If it is the case that DATIM values should be updated, follow the usual process for OPU Target changes, requesting all necessary approvals to initiate and expedite this process during COP. Once changes are aprroved, either through an OPU for targets, or through data change request for results, you can enter the new values into the related column of the DataPack yourself. If you wish to request a new DataPack, you may do so, but will have to start the DataPack process afresh. For either of these routes, reach out to the DataPack Systems Team via Zendesk for support.

Please use the *.zip version from January 21st. This new released version addresses small bugs that were caught after the initial version was released. It also added in missing ROUND functions into formulas on the Cascade tab as well as correcting comments to properly reflect COP Guidance. 2.1 datapackr 5.1.1 2.1.1 Bug fixes This maintenance release fixes a bug with unPackCountryUIDs that was introduced in v5.0.1 due to linting. This bug preventing the processing of COP and OPU tools in datapackr-app as well as broke the createAnalytics function for regional tools. 2.2 datapackr 5.1.0 2.2.1 Breaking changes The function packForDATIM_UndistributedMER now takes in arguments for MER data and COP year instead of an entire d object and returns a table of undistributed MER data rather than return a d object with data nested under d$data$UndistributedMER. 2.2.2 New features Updates COP22 Data Pack template and processing code. Removes Summary tab from COP22 tools and processing code. Includes Not PEPFAR column to PSNUxIM tab and adds support for processing this data. Drops dataf from this column before creating the analytics table and MER exports. Adds item to d object for unallocated IMs nested under d$info$unallocatedIMs. 2.2.3 Minor improvements and fixes Additional handling for default Category Option Combos. Adds dataset UIDs for COP22 to the getDatasetUids function. Updates getMapDataPack_DATIM_DEs_COCs to include handling for COP22 map. Adds test for getDatasetUids Adds explicit comparison checks when updating schemas and Data Pack-DATIM mapping files using the waldo package. 2.3 datapackr 5.0.3 2.3.1 New features Initial launch of COP22 Data Pack processing! 2.3.2 Breaking changes Now requires R version 4.1.1 or higher. 2.3.3 Minor improvements and fixes Updated and improved documentation of datasets in datapackr. Improves handling of default categoryOptionCombo. Improves documentation of packDataPackSheet, packSheets, and prepareSheetData. 2.3.4 Deprecated features loginToDATIM is retired in favor of the same function in datimutils. All instances of this function being invoked have been replaced appropriately. The functions DHISLogin, GetCredentialsFromConsole, LoadConfigFile, and ValidateConfig were not exported and are now deprecated as well. They were previously only used by loginToDATIM. isLoggedIn is retired as it was only used in getMechList and loginToDATIM. 2.4 datapackr 5.0.2 2.4.1 Bug fixes Resolves a bug with packOPUDataPack where createDataPack was not implemented correctly in version 5.0.1. Patches a bug with getOPUDataFromDATIM where getCOPDataFromDATIM returns a dataframe where the default Category Option Combo UID is listed as default rather than the appropriate DATIM UID. This will be removed in favor of a more permanent solution in future updates. 2.4.2 New features Significantly improves handling of parameter checks and standardizes their validation and defaults. Documentation for these checks is also added. Adds functionality for producing COP22 Beta Packs and test data. 2.4.3 Breaking changes Removes getDataPackSchema in favor of consolidated pick_schema. 2.4.4 Deprecated features getDataPackSchema has been deprecated in favor of pick_schema and has been replaced in the two locations where it was previously used. 2.4.5 Minor improvements and fixes Improves and updates tests related to parameter checks and schemas. Introduces many new small utilities functions such as %missing% and %||%. Improves automation of Data Pack Template/schema validation. 2.5 datapackr 5.0.1 2.5.1 New features loadDataPack is a new function that returns a Data Pack object conserving styles and formatting of the original Data Pack .xlsx file, as well as other metadata necessary for processing and analysing data in the Data Pack. .testInvalidIndicatorCodes was previously an internal function that is now documented and exported by the package. This function tests for invalid indicator codes in a d Datapackr object. datapack_cogs is a new dataset containing Datapack Category option groups (id and name) along with their individual category options (id and name) as a nested data frame. 2.5.2 Breaking changes createWorkbook has been renamed createDataPack to deconflict with the openxlsx function createWorkbook. This function now returns a d datapackr object rather than an openxlsx workbook object. The d2_session argument has been removed from the following functions: check_params createDataPack (previously createWorkbook) unPackSchema_datapack 2.5.3 Minor improvements and fixes unPackSchema_datapack was modified in the following ways: Now uses the datapack_cogs data set rather than making a query to DATIM. Inherits parameters from datapackr_params. writeHomeTab was modified in the following ways: The wb and datapack_name arguments default to NULL. Checks and assigns parameters using the check_params function. Lists country names on the Home tab in addition to Country UIDs. Minor corrections were made to Excel functions written by packSNUxIM that had been erroneously changed during previous linting. Internal changes were made to variable names and functions used inside the check_params function. A new file has been added to data-raw to generate the datapack_cogs data set. Documentation is now provided for the cop20OPU_data_pack_schema data set. "],["03-Whats-New.html", "3 Whats New?", " 3 Whats New? 3.0.0.1 Section 7 Changes Reorienting of the Cascade Tab around PVLS, rather than ART Coverage, although both are taken into account. This years new shift to begin setting the Cascade from Program Viral Load Suppression. This starting point will allow for country team users to build up a full cascade that will provide insight into VLS, VL Testing and how this will translate into determining the new on treatment and those returning to treatment. It will provide a full picture of the treatment ecosystem and the way in which countries understand if they will achieve 85% coverage across all three Cascades. This will allow countries that are at or close to Epidemic Control to better approach the understanding of how they will continue to sustain their 95-95-95 goals. This approach will put a greater emphasis on the Coverage Cascade as the driver of the target setting process, a direct shift from the past 5 years that have focused on the first two Cascades, and paint a picture of both VL to gap in Treatment and Testing. 3.0.0.2 MER2.6 Changes Changes in line with MER 2.6: Use of PrEP_CT in lieu of PrEP_CURR. Integration of the new SNS modality. 50+ finer age bands across the clinical cascade. These will be aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR. The introduction of 65+ age bands for TX_CURR targets this year will be visible across the Cascade, PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs. For structural purposes of these tabs to seamlessly work with the new inclusion of the 50+ finer age bands, targets will be set across many indicators at the finer age bands across the clinical cascade. The most important thing for users to note is that these will be aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR. The breakdown that has been used to disaggregate the 50+ age band into the finer age bands up to 65+ is the following: 50-54: 42% 55-59: 35% 60-64 14% 65+: 9% These percentages were determined through various research studies. If teams feel as though they need to adjust the breakdowns based on local data and research they are able to do so, but should first consult their Chair, PPM and DUIT Liaison. 3.0.0.3 PSNUxIM Tool Formulas The PSNUxIM tab will now be split into its own separate tool. When you received your newly generated PSNUxIM tool for the first time, you will need to scroll to the Target Values Section that begins in column CW and copy down the formulas populated in row 15 all the way down to the bottom of your DataPack. This will be required in order for your Rollup column to properly populate as well as the Deduplication sections. "],["04-Frequently-Asked-Questions.html", "4 Frequently Asked Questions", " 4 Frequently Asked Questions Q: Why are there more than just TX_CURR (FY23) Indicators being set at the new finer 65+ age bands despite MER2.6 Guidance? A: Due to the structure of the Cascade tab, and other COP22 - FY23 Targets that rely on TX_CURR (FY23), the tool had to be built, such that these tabs are all disaggregated to the the 65+ age band. However, upon completion of the DataPack, ONLY TX_CURR (FY23) will be import to DATIM with the finer age bands. All other indicators will be aggregated to 50+. Q: When working through PSNUxIM KP mechanism allocations and I allocate the KP-specific targets to KP partners, given that the KP disaggregates are a subset of the total population being targeted, do I also need to allocate total pop targets to the KP partner? A: Yes, you should be setting a corresponding Total Pop target against each mechanism you set KeyPop targets against. This is because KeyPop is a subset of Total Pop. Note however, that only clinical, facility partners may have targets and report many indicators. For these indicators, the KP targets must be assigned to a partner and site qualified to report the results. Q: Can you use FY23 Spectrum estimates to work through the Cascade tab? A: No, unless you receive approval from OGAC Leadership you should use FY22 Spectrum Data. Your target setting process for the COP22 DataPack should be to set FY23 targets based on where you are ending FY22. Q: Is the coverage rate that is used to calculate Targeted Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22) and Targeted Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) too high or being miscalculated? A: No, this is not a formula error. The calculations occurring are focusing on PLHIV for each district that are being treated for HIV/AIDS for each age band, as opposed to those being treated for HIV/AIDS in the district regardless of whether they live in that district. if the PEPFAR results are higher than the PLHIV Spectrum estimate in a particular district, then back-calculating the coverage rate shows a greater than 100% value for that PSNU-Age-Sex band. This can come from one of two things generally: People are coming from outside the district to seek treatment, leading to a higher PEPFAR TX_CURR value than PLHIV in the district; or The PLHIV estimate from Spectrum is too low. Either way if you have good programmatic reason for doing so, particularly health seeking behavior of PLHIV, you can aim for a coverage rate even higher than 100% (e.g., current coverage in capital city is estimated at 105%, but due to health seeking behavior you want to aim for 120% to achieve 95% for across all metropolitan area). Q: Why in the newly generated PSNUxIM tab are data-pack totals and roll up columns blank? A: Once you have regenerated your PSNUxIM tab from the DataPack Self-Service app, please open your newly regenerated tool, save your tool and close it. When you reopen your tool, it should populate your targets into that column. You will also need to drag down the formula in the far right Target Values section of the PSNUxIM tab to ensure all rows are populated with the proper formula. Q: If my program performs testing but not treatment, how do I represent this in the DataPack? A: You will first need approval from OGAC Leadership to do this. If you receive this approval you will need to manually alter in the Cascade Tab column HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS (FY22) (BD). Please make the alterations to this column and not on the HTS tab. Q: When I try to validate my DataPack in the self-service app, I get a message saying ERROR: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification. How do I resolve this? A: This error can be caused by a number of different issues. The most common causes and their resolutions include: Trying to validate a newly regenerated DataPack before opening it and saving it. After generating or regenerating your PSNUxIM tab, it is necessary to first open your tool and save it before uploading it to the app. The browser is causing issues with the app. This can be resolved by opening an Incognito window or by clearing your cache. PLEASE NOTE: Clearing your cache will sign you out of all accounts in that browser. Trying to validate a file that isnt an XLSX. If your team has saved your DataPack in a different file format for sharing, such as XLSB, ensure that you resave the file as an XLSX before validating it in the app. The target distribution formulas on the PSNUxIM tab have not been applied to all rows. By default, the formulas in the Target Value section (Column CW and right) are only applied to Row 15. Once you generate or regenerate your PSNUxIM tab, ensure that you copy these formulas all the way down to the bottom row of your targets. After this is done, try validating your tool again. If none of the above issues apply to your DataPack tool and you are still receiving this error, please submit a ZenDesk ticket identifying your country and attaching or linking to a copy of the DataPack tool that caused the error in the app. "],["05-Cheat_Sheet.html", "5 Testing Targets Cheat Sheet 5.1 Purpose 5.2 Issue 5.3 Is this issue in my DataPack? 5.4 Why is this issue in my DataPack? 5.5 Possible solutions 5.6 How to try these solutions in the DataPack", " 5 Testing Targets Cheat Sheet 5.1 Purpose The purpose of this cheat sheet is to document a recurring DataPack issue to guide other OUs towards a solution. This document does not supersede PEPFAR guidance. For more questions, please contact the ICPI Zendesk. 5.2 Issue Our HTS_TST_POS targets from modalities are summing to over 100% of the HTS_TST_POS total. We have too many positives but cannot figure out how to resolve the errors in the datapack? 5.3 Is this issue in my DataPack? This issue is most likely to affect countries with high treatment coverage but has been seen in lower coverage OUs as well If your DataPack has negative values in the Other Modalities (Cascade Tab; Column BR) or a large HTS POS difference to adjust (HTS Tab; Column BO) AND You have already walked through the instructions in the Datapack User Guide HTS Section link HERE 5.4 Why is this issue in my DataPack? COP guidance recommends that age/sex/SNU combinations with high treatment coverage (above 80%) have a high rate of positives (75%) coming from index testing, but countries may already have more than 25% of positives coming from other passive modalities (PMTCT, TB). Countries with lower treatment coverage will have different recommendations for positives from index testing; See figure 2.3.2.2 on page 66 of the COP guidance for more details. Even in settings with only 30% of positives coming from index testing you may still see this issue. 5.5 Possible solutions Work with your PMTCT and TB program colleagues to review your program and surveillance data and increase the percentage of known positives coming from PMTCT (and other modalities, such as TB and VMMC) Changes in PMTCT are most likely to decrease high positives (while maintaining ambitious targets for your PMTCT program) See examples below for PMTCT and TB indicators If still unable to resolve high positives, need to ask permission from SGAC Chair, PPM, and DUIT liaisons to change underlying assumptions set by COP Guidance, such as % of positives that come from Index Testing Be prepared to share what the value should be and provide justification For example, in one Operating Unit, PEPFAR has already transitioned all funding lower yield provider-initiated testing (PITC) to the Ministry of Health (through Global Fund support); despite being lower yield these modalities still identify approximately 50% of positives needed to be identified at PEPFAR supported sites; it is, therefore, not possible to obtain 75% positives from PEPFAR supported index testing 5.6 How to try these solutions in the DataPack Remember that you can only change the sea green columns in the DP. The following solutions are in order of impact (high to low). 5.6.1 PMTCT Tab - decrease positives from ANC and Post-ANC1 Goal: To reduce column AE Newly Tested, Positive which feeds into the total HTS_TST_POS values that are too high Shift positives from newly tested to known positives Column Z Est. % ANC1 clients already Known HIV Positive (%) Increasing column Z directly increases column AD Known HIV Status, Positive by the same amount it decreases column AF Newly Tested, Negative ultimate reducing Newly Tested Positives This reduction in New Positives may be small Column AB Est. Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients (%) Decreasing column AB directly decreases column AE Newly Tested, Positive by the same amount it decreases column AF Newly Tested, Negative This reduction in Newly Tested Positives will be bigger, proceed with caution Goal: To reduce Column AU Positives from Post ANC1 This change will most likely only have a small impact on your total positives Increasing Known Positives (in step above) reduces Column AQ Total eligible for Post ANC1 retesting thereby reducing column AU Positive Column AS Yield (%) Reducing Yield will reduce Positive (AU) While it is not plausible to see no positives from Post ANC1, consider a programmatic maximum that you would like to target While it is possible to change Column AQ, we recommend not altering this column directly so as to not create logical gaps in PMTCT testing process 5.6.2 TB tab - decrease positives from TB Goal: To reduce column Q Newly Tested, Positive which feeds into the total HTS_TST_POS values that are too high Shift positives from newly tested to known positives Column L Est. % TB clients already Known HIV Positive (%) Increasing column L directly increases column P Known HIV Status, Positive by the same amount it decreases column R Newly Tested, Negative ultimate reducing Newly Tested Positives This reduction in New Positives may be small Column N Est.

The Cascade tab of the COP22 DataPack saw the most changes across all tabs from the COP21 version. New Section 7 COP guidance will begin setting the Cascade from Program Viral Load Suppression. This starting point will allow for country team users to build up a full cascade that will provide insight into VLS, VL Testing and how this will translate into determining the new on treatment and those returning to treatment. It will provide a full picture of the treatment ecosystem and the way in which countries understand if they will achieve 85% coverage across all three Cascades. This will allow countries that are at or close to Epi Control to better approach the understanding of how they will continue to sustain their 95-95-95 goals. This approach will put a greater emphasis on the Coverage Cascade as the driver of the target setting process, a direct shift from the past 5 years that have focused on the first two Cascades, and paint a picture of both VL to gap in Treatment and Testing. This tab also links heavily with many other tabs of the Data Pack, including the PMTCT, TB, EID, VMMC, KP, HTS, CXCA, HTS_RECENT, and TX_TB_PREV tabs. By beginning with the Cascade tab, moving through each of these other tabs, and continually returning to the Cascade tab to monitor and iteratively adjust the overall program plan, Country Teams can both retain a cohesive and intentional strategy across program area, geography, and population, as well as anchor this strategy in data and the realities of past performance. 10.1 Host Country Context F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Column Name NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA UID POP_EST.T_1 POP_EST.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 PLHIV.T_1 PLHIV.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 HIV_PREV.T_1 HIV_PREV.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 Incidence_SUBNAT.Rt.T_1 Incidence_SUBNAT.Rt.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 NEW_INFECTIONS_SUBNAT.T_1 NEW_INFECTIONS_SUBNAT.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.T_1 DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.DistrictUncertainty.R TX_CURR_SUBNAT.R TX_CURR_SUBNAT.DistrictUncertainty.R TX_CURR_SUBNAT.T_1 TX_CURR_SUBNAT.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 VL_TESTING_SUBNAT.T_1 VL_TESTING_SUBNAT.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 VL_SUPPRESSED.T_1 VL_SUPPRESSED.DistrictUncertainty.T_1 Column Type? target reference target reference target reference reference reference reference reference target reference result reference target reference reference reference target reference What type of data? integer percentage integer percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage integer percentage integer percentage integer percentage integer percentage integer percentage integer percentage Prepopulated data?

Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22)\\(VL\\_SUPPRESSION\\_SUBNAT.T\\_1\\): Estimated PLHIV on ART and virally suppressed, projected as of September 2022. 10.1.1 DATIM Import As part of the DataPack approval process, all of the above FY22 projected estimates will be uploaded into DATIM and replace any preexisting estimates for these indicators that may have already been entered in DATIM, perhaps via Data Pack upload during COP21. 10.1.2 Instructions If using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data: Review the above columns to confirm that data has been correctly linked with the Spectrum tab. You may consider using filter drop-down menus to quickly inspect for any non-numeric, negative, or invalid data. Review Relative Standard Error values to identify any estimates with a Relative Standard Error of more than or equal to 20. See the section below for additional instructions. If not using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data, see the below section. Confirm that no data has been entered against Military Organization Units. See below for more explanation. 10.1.3 Leveraging Alternatives to Spectrum In general, all data for the above should use UNAIDS Spectrum as their source. However, there may be cases where either a more up to date or reliable source exists, or where data may not be fully available from UNAIDS Spectrum. In these cases, Country Teams may request approval from their PPM and a DUIT Liaison to use an alternative data source. Be sure to request and document this approval before deciding not to use Spectrum as the source for your Data Pack host country estimates, as well as what source is approved for use in its place. This is true for all cases where you may need to leverage an alternative to Spectrum, whether for an entire indicator, or for a specific geography or population. For those not leveraging Spectrum to provide host country context estimates, you may paste estimates from other approved sources into this section of the Cascade tab by overwriting the formulas currently in these columns. Due to hidden Relative Standard Error columns between the various estimate columns, it is recommended you paste this data in one column at a time, rather than in bulk. It may also reduce technical issues to first copy geographic data in the SNU1, PSNU, Age, and Sex columns into a separate spreadsheet, then use Excel lookup functions to add estimates data against the correct geographies and populations, and then return to pasting data into the original Cascade tab column by column. 10.1.4 Relative Standard Errors Data exported from UNAIDS Spectrum will also come with a series Relative Standard Errors for each data point, both at the District level as well as the Age/Sex-specific level. Along with the data points listed above, Relative Standard Errors for each will also automatically be populated in the Cascade tab from data loaded into the Spectrum tab. While initially, these Error columns will be hidden, you may inspect these values by unhiding these columns. Based on these Relative Standard Errors, data points in related columns will be color-coded to indicate the relative uncertainty of each specific data point along the following ranges: Red: Relative Standard Error of 40 or greater. Yellow: Relative Standard Error of less than 40, but more than or equal to 20. Green: Relative Standard Error of less than 20. While these error estimates are available as a reference as teams formulate targets, red or yellow highlighting may not always mean a data point should be thrown out, nor is it the case that all green values should be taken at face value. Either way, consider these error estimates as helpful guideposts in interpreting the contextual meaning and data quality of data provided via UNAIDS Spectrum output. If, in reviewing Relative Standard Error values, the uncertainty interval of an estimate appears to be concerning, consider the following next steps: Raise and discuss the issue with your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Communicate concerns to assigned UNAIDS liaisons and discuss appropriate methods for improving or better understanding data quality for the data points in question. 10.1.5 Host Country Estimates for Military Organization Units Due to issues of political sensitivity and national security, estimates for the above indicators should not be entered against Military Organization Units. Any case where this does occur will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App, and removed during DATIM import. 10.2 Host Country Cascade With the pivot to setting the Cascade from a Program Viral Load Suppression rate this section will provide users with further insight into all three Cascades. This approach will also put a greater emphasis on the Coverage Cascade as the driver of the target setting process, a direct shift from the past 5 years that have focused on the first two Cascades. 10.3 PEPFAR Programmatic Cascade This section has been added in an effort to further highlight the progress being made as well as painting a picture of both VL to gap in Treatment and Testing. These columns will be populated with FY21 Results and FY22 Targets from DATIM and will serve as further reference as users set targets throughout the Cascade tab. 10.4 Cascade: PEPFAR FY21 Cascade (Observed and Planned) Z AA AB AC AD Column Name NA NA NA NA NA UID HTS_TST.Pos.Total_With_HEI.R TX_NEW.R TX_CURR.R TX_PVLS.D.Routine.R TX_PVLS.N.Routine.R Column Type? calculation past past past past What type of data? integer integer integer integer integer Prepopulated data?

N N N N N This section of the Cascade tab builds upon the preceding Host Country Context and the PEPFAR Programmatic Cascade sections to arrive at an analysis of gap to VL coverage by geography and population. This analysis, in concert with projected goals for VL to gap in TX and VL gap to testing to be attained by the end of FY23, then helps DataPack users simulate the required net new amount of individuals (those added less those lost to follow-up) to be added to host country ART totals. 10.5.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: Targeted Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) \\(VL\\_SUPPRESSED.T\\) 10.5.2 Instructions Review historic PEPFAR PVLS_NET_NEW and Coverage of Host Country PopVLS data to understand existing trends and status of Host Country VLS by geography and population. Review estimates of PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT and adjust as necessary. See below for additional information. Review baseline Host Country Estimated PopVLS Rate Coverage. Review and adjust Targeted Host Country PopVLS Rate Coverage. See below for additional information Review resulting Targeted Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUB NAT and Targeted Host Country VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT. See below for additional information. 10.5.3 PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT In the next section of the Data Pack, the VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT determined in this section will be used to estimate necessary PEPFAR TX_PVLS_NET_NEW. To estimate PEPFARs contribution to total TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT in the country, the Data Pack compares PEPFARs most recent APR results for TX_CURR against the observed host country TX_CURR_SUBNAT results  sourced from UNAIDS Spectrum, or an alternative approved source, as described in the Host Country Context section prior to this  for the same time period. While the behavior of PEPFAR and Host Country TX_CURR may differ from that of TX_NET_NEW, this gives a baseline from which to begin, and ultimately you may adjust this baseline in the green column titled PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) (%) to more accurately reflect the likely reality of PEPFARs contribution to TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT. 10.5.4 Targeted Host Country PopVLS Coverage One of the most pivotal data points in the Data Pack is the baseline estimate of Host Country PopVLS Coverage. To calculate the estimated Host Country PopVLS Coverage for FY22 (i.e., projected as of September 2022), the Data Pack uses the following formula: In the case that PEPFARs reported TX_CURR results for FY20 exceed the reported Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT for FY20, the following function will be used to calculate ART Coverage instead of the above: Reviewing and understanding the PopVLS Coverage estimate arrived at in this column is critical for much of the rest of the Data Pack. In particular, this column is later instrumental in determining the following key data points: Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUB NAT Host Country VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT PEPFAR TX_PVLS PEPFAR TX_NEW PEPFAR TX_CURR PEPFAR TX_CURR_SUBNAT PEPFAR HTS_TST totals PEPFAR HTS_INDEX After reviewing data in this column, examine the next column, Targeted Host Country PopVLS Coverage (FY22) (%). In line with the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals, this column defaults to 95%, reflecting that since the denominator in the Data Pack calculation is Host Country Estimated PLHIV instead of only those PLHIV who know their HIV Status, this column should be the equivalent of: However, in cases where baseline PopVLS Coverage may be greater than 95%, baseline PopVLS Coverage will be used instead of 95%. No matter the starting default for Targeted Host Country PopVLS Coverage, you may adjust this target to fit the realities of your country context, and the strategy of your treatment program. It may also be helpful to return to this column to iteratively adjust it as you proceed through the next few sections of the Data Pack. NOTE: The Data Pack will not prevent situations resulting in ART coverage exceeding 100% in a given PSNU, but will flag these cases in yellow to highlight when it occurs. Given that these may be a common occurrence in cases of urban PSNUs, they are allowable in the Data Pack, though should be coordinated with PPMs and DUIT Liaisons. 10.5.5 Targeted VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT and VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT Targeted Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) is set as follows (rounded to the nearest integer): Based on this target, Targeted Host Country VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY23) is set as follows: In performing this calculation, the Data Pack also compares projected FY21 Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT values reported in the Data Pack against FY21 PEPFAR TX_CURR targets as contained in DATIM. If PEPFAR targets exceed Host Country projected TX_CURR_SUBNAT values for FY21, Targeted Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT for FY22 is instead calculated as follows: For those using Spectrum as their source for TX_CURR_SUBNAT projections, this scenario is rare because of incorporation of PEPFAR TX_CURR targets into Spectrum modeling. However, it may be possible to see discrepancies between PEPFAR TX_CURR targets and modeled TX_CURR_SUBNAT values, especially as Country Teams continue to make necessary OPU target changes. In this case, as well as in cases where data from alternative sources may exhibit discrepancies, the Data Pack takes this into account and adjusts to maintain reasonable Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT targets as best as possible. 10.5.6 Gap to Coverage Analysis for Military Organization Units Due to sensitivities around ART coverage estimates for Military organization units and populations, this data will not be reflected here in the Data Pack. Country Teams should coordinate closely with Department of Defense liaisons who will perform a similar analysis based on available data sources and then directly paste resulting TX_CURR targets into the Data Pack against the _Military organization unit, overwriting the formulas present in the TX_CURR column described in the next section. 10.6 Cascade: TX_PVLS (N) TX_PVLS (N): Number of ART patients with suppressed VL results (&lt;1,000 copies/mL) documented in the medical or laboratory results/LIS within the past 12 months.

This is defaulted to match the PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country PopVLS (FY22) set in the VLS_NET_NEW_SUBNAT section of the Cascade tab, but can be altered as appropriate. Review targeted TX_PVLS_NET_NEW for routine viral load testing. See below for additional information. Review targeted VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT. See below for additional information.

See below for additional information. 10.7.3 TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY23) While MER 2.6 allows for both Routine and Targeted Viral Load testing, only Routine Viral Load testing will be targeted as part of COP 22 planning. Within the Data Pack, TX_PVLS Denominator targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: Note that no retention rates are applied against either TX_NEWt nor TX_CURRt-1 , reflecting the goal that all individuals on ART should be tested for viral load suppression, no matter whether they may in the future  even within the same Fiscal Year  be lost to follow-up. 10.8 Cascade: VLT Coverage AV AW AX AY AZ BA BB BC BD BE BF BG BH BI BJ BK BL Column Name NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA UID DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.Rt.T_1 PLHIV.Undiagnosed.T_1 NEW_INFECTIONS_SUBNAT.ART.Rt.T TX_CURR_SUBNAT.Rt.T_1 DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.NoART.T_1 HTS_TST.Linkage.R HTS_TST.Linkage.T_1 HTS_TST.Linkage.T TX_PVLS.D.Eligible.Rt.T VL_TESTING_SUBNAT.Rt.T_1 TX_PVLS.D.Rt.T_1 TX_PVLS.D.Rt.T TX_CURR.New.NewInfections.T TX_CURR.New.NonNewInfections.T TX_CURR.New.T TX_EVLT.T TX_PVLS.D.RtFinal.T Column Type? reference reference assumption reference reference reference reference assumption assumption reference reference assumption reference reference reference reference reference What type of data? percentage integer percentage percentage integer percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage integer integer integer integer percentage Prepopulated data?

Review historic data for TX_NEW Results and Targets for reference from the PEPFAR Programmatic Cascade section. Review FY23 TX_NEW targets and return to previous sections to adjust assumptions and modeling decisions as necessary. See below for additional information. 10.9.3 Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART Initiation New to the COP21 Data Pack, this column allows for several scenarios that may impact how PEPFAR TX_NET_NEW translates to TX_NEW targets. The most common of these scenarios include: Cases where TX_RTT may contribute in part to TX_NET_NEW, requiring a reduction in how much TX_NET_NEW is converted into targets for TX_NEW. While TX_RTT targets are not set in the COP21 Data Pack, this column does allow for the possibility that some amount of TX_RTT may be an unavoidable part of a cohesive, effective treatment strategy. Cases where PEPFAR may be absorbing or beginning support for an existing Treatment cohort from a non-PEPFAR partner, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Red highlighting will identify cases where this column is set above 100%, and yellow highlighting where it is set below 100% for review purposes. As described below, any adjustments to this column will directly impact the target set for TX_NEW. As such, be sure to receive approval from your PPM and DUIT Liaison for any changes to this column, and be prepared to explain and justify the rationale for these changes as necessary. It is important to note that even in cases where TX_NET_NEW may be zero, it still may be necessary to add individuals into the Treatment cohort, whether from new initiation or otherwise, to compensate for those individuals lost to follow up. In these scenarios, the proportion described in this section will apply to this non-zero total of individuals to be added to the Treatment cohort. In other words, the Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART Initiation can be described as: As explained above, the number of individuals to be added to the Treatment Cohort may not be the same as TX_NET_NEW in all cases due to Retention Rates among the prior year Treatment Cohort. In other words, and given that therefore, All this means that the Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART can be framed as follows: See below to see how this affects TX_NEW targeting. 10.9.4 TX_NEW (FY22) For those one year old and older, PEPFAR TX_NEW targets for FY23 will be set using the formula laid out above for Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART, solving for TX_NEW, with each component and the total rounded to the nearest integer: See below for additional information about how TX_NEW targets are set among Infant populations. 10.9.5 Setting TX_NEW Targets among Infant Populations Based upon rationales explained in previous sections above, TX_NEW targets for infant populations will simply reflect TX_NET_NEW values determined in the TX_CURR section of the Cascade tab. Refer to that section for more information about how to adjust TX_NEW targets for infant populations. 10.10 Cascade: TX_CURR TX_CURR: Number of adults and children currently receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Adjust assumptions in previous sections as necessary. (See below for additional information about TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT targeting.) Review FY22 TX_CURR targets to identify and resolve any issues pertaining to previous modeling assumptions or decisions. (See below for additional information about TX_CURR targeting.) For infant populations: Continue moving on through the remainder of the Cascade tab, taking special care to review the PMTCT and EID tabs of the Data Pack, reconciling issues with overall Testing Rationalization along the way. Once modeling of PMTCT, EID, and HEI_POS targets is complete, return to this section of the Data Pack to review how HEI_POS targets on the EID tab link to TX_CURR on the Cascade tab. See below for additional information. 10.10.3 TX_NET_NEW (FY23) For those one year old and older, TX_NET_NEW targets for FY22 are set in the Data Pack as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: For a description of how TX_NET_NEW is modeled for infants, see section below. 10.10.4 TX_CURR (FY23) For those one year old and older, TX_CURR targets for FY22 are set in the Data Pack as follows: For a description of how TX_CURR is modeled for infants, see section below. 10.10.5 Setting TX_CURR Targets among Infant Population Groups Because infants enter the Treatment cohort through a distinctly separate method than the rest of the population, and also given that all infants in the previous years Treatment cohort will entirely shift into the 1-4 year old age group leaving none to carry over into the next years cohort, TX_CURR targets for this population do not follow the chain of logic described thus far. Instead, TX_CURR targets for infants are driven by the model for EID testing, which is in turn based on the model for PMTCT testing and treatment. As described above in the Instructions section for this tab, upon confirming targets set in the PMTCT and EID tabs, return to the PMTCT_HEI_POS Linked to ART (FY22) column in this section to review ART targets for infants. Because HEI_POS targets are set without disaggregation by sex, these are allocated equally to male and female infants in the Cascade tab. Because all infants in the previous years Treatment cohort will entirely shift into the 1-4 year old age group, both TX_NET_NEW and TX_CURR for infants will reflect 100% of the value in the PMTCT_HEI_POS Linked to ART (FY22) column. 10.11 Cascade: TX_CURR_SUBNAT BT BU BV Column Name NA NA NA UID TX_CURR_SUBNAT.T PopART.Rt.T_1 PopART.Rt.T Column Type? target reference reference What type of data? integer percentage percentage Prepopulated data?

This is defaulted to 0%, reflecting an emphasis for Test and Start approaches for testing and linkage to treatment. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages changed from the default. Review the total TX_NEW from all other sources (FY22) for those to be linked to treatment from all HTS and EID testing modalities. Review observed ART Linkage Rate, based on FY20 Results reported in DATIM, for historical context. Review and adjust Targeted ART Linkage Rates for FY22. These are defaulted to 95%, but can be adjusted as necessary. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages below 95%. Review the Percent of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX from FY20 results, based on data reported in DATIM, for historical context. Review and adjust Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX for FY22. These are set based on FY21 ART Coverage, per COP 21 Guidance, but can be altered as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages above 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages below thresholds stipulated in COP 21 Guidance. See below for additional information. Review total testing targets (HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS) for FY22. Where necessary, return to previous assumptions and adjust appropriately. Review total Index testing targets (HTS_INDEX) for FY22 and adjust the Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTX_INDEX for FY22 as necessary. Review FY22 targets for PMTCT_STAT New Positives and HTS_TST Post ANC1 New Positives and navigate to the PMTCT tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY22 targets for TB_STAT New Positives and navigate to the TB tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY22 targets for VMMC_CIRC Tested Positives and navigate to the VMMC tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY22 targets for PMTCT_HEI_POS and navigate to the EID tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. For infants under 1 year old, 100% of testing targets should come through PMTCT_HEI_POS. See below for additional information. Review FY22 targets for HTS_TST_POS from All Other Modalities and navigate to the HTS tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review percentage contributions toward FY22 targeted Total Positives from HTS_INDEX, PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC, PMTCT_HEI_POS, and All Other Modalities. Red highlights across these columns indicate cases where targets have been over- or under-distributed across modalities. See below for additional information about reconciling discrepancies among these modalities. 10.12.3 Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX Per COP 21 Guidance, the total number of positives targeted to be identified through Index Testing is initially modeled based on FY21 ART Coverage as follows: ART Coverage &lt; 70%: 30% of total positives to be identified through Index Testing ART Coverage &gt;= 70% &amp; &lt;80%: 50% of total positives to be identified through Index Testing ART Coverage &gt;= 80%: 75% of total positives to be identified through Index Testing In cases where historic FY20 results showed Index Testing contributing to more than this share of testing, the larger value will be used. Again, while modeled per the above, this value can adjusted as needed. 10.12.4 Testing Rationalization As testing targets are set in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, and EID tabs, these will be reflected here on the Cascade tab to reconcile against those high-level testing targets set following the logic flow set forth in preceding sections. This section of the Cascade tab can serve as a sort of Table of Contents to help you navigate across these various tabs as you adjust assumptions and reconcile targets. Similar Testing Rationalization sections exist in each of these separate tabs for easier reference. Red highlighting will indicate any case where over- or under-distribution of testing targets across testing modalities has occurred, keying primarily from the Total Positives from All Other Modalities (FY22) (%) column. As these issues arise, determine whether these issues require adjustment of either preceding Treatment and total Testing targets, or related targets in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, or EID tabs. After testing targets have been allocated to PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, and PMTCT_HEI_POS, any remainder will be available for further allocation against all remaining testing modalities in the HTS tab of the Data Pack. 10.12.5 Testing Targets for Infant Populations Similar to targets for HIV-positive infants linked to ART as explained above, targets for infants identified as HIV-positive are initially set in the EID tab, without sex disaggregation. In reflecting these in the Cascade tab, these values are equally allocated across male and female infants. Per COP 21 Guidance, 100% of these testing targets for infant populations should be accommodated for via PMTCT_HEI_POS, and no other modality. Should any portion of these targets be allocated to any other modality, an alert will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App. Conditional formatting within the Data Pack will also indicate when this has occurred. 10.13 Cascade: Testing Reference Distribution CJ CK CL CM CN CO CP Column Name NA NA NA NA NA NA NA UID HTS_TST.Index.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.PMTCT_STAT.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.PostANC1.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.TB.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.VMMC.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.HEI_POS.Share.T HTS_TST.Total_Other.Pos.Share.T Column Type? reference reference reference reference reference reference reference What type of data? percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage Prepopulated data?

Review and adjust the Expected change in new ANC clients, which should help indicate whether there is an anticipated change in the number of women presenting to ANC compared to FY22. This is defaulted at 0%, though this reflects no suggestion of strategy from S/GAC. Adjust these growth rates to reflect intentional, data-driven, strategic programming. Values can be negative or positive percentages in this column, which will decrease or increase the FY23 target for PMTCT_STAT (D) respectively. (If the expected number of women presenting in ANC for FY22 is the same as FY21, the value in column F would be 0%. If it increased by 50%, the value would be 50%. If the number should decrease by 20%, enter -20%.) Review FY23 targets for PMTCT_STAT (D), which is calculated by multiplying the Expected change in new ANC clients (set in step 2) by the lesser of either the Host Country PMTCT_STAT_SUBNAT (D) - # New ANC clients (FY22) set in the Host Country Context section, or the PMTCT_STAT (D) FY22 targets from DATIM.

Review FY23 projections for (a) Estimated % ANC1 clients with already Known HIV Positive status, and (b) Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients. These data default to remain static from related FY22 rates added to the Host Country Context section of this tab. Where these are unavailable, these instead use FY21 results trends. In either case, these can be adjusted as necessary with approval by your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages different from FY21 results. See below for additional information. Review Total PMTCT_STAT (N), which will display the numerator value for PMTCT_STAT based on the multiplication of PMTCT_STAT (D) and the Targeted testing coverage of ANC1 clients (FY23). To make changes to the PMTCT numerator, adjust either the PMTCT denominator or the desired testing coverage. Review PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive, which will be calculated based on multiplying Total PMTCT_STAT (N) by the Estimated percent of ANC1 clients already Known HIV Positive. Review PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positive, which will be calculated based on first removing the PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive cohort from Total PMTCT_STAT (N), then by multiplying this value by the Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients.

This column serves as the starting point of the EID modeling process on the EID tab. For more information about the role of this data relative to EID targets, see that section of this User Guide. Use the remainder of this section of the PMTCT tab to analyze how PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positives fit within the context of an overall testing strategy. In particular, consider how this modality contributes to total HTS_TST_POS in relation to HTS_INDEX, TB_STAT, and all other HTS modalities. Review any cases where this section is highlighted red, indicating over- or under-allocation of HTS_TST_POS targets across contributing modalities. While these allocation issues may be more the result of a different modality(ies), analysis of these to confirm no adjustments to PMTCT_STAT are warranted may prevent issues and additional work in other sections of the DataPack. Return to other tabs of the DataPack where issues flagged in this section require adjustment of either total HTS_TST_POS targets, or targets via other modalities.

This tab is provided to facilitate and inform (1) data-driven program intent or relationships amongst indicators, where relevant, for KP programming and (2) easy review of all KP-related targets by virtue of having all KP-related targets in one tab. Importantly, pre-built algorithms and pre-set assumptions are NOT included in this tab. As such, entry of data into any columns labelled Assumptions or Projected MAY NOT automatically produce targets for the indicators listed. Considerations as you complete and use this tab: As per the COP22 Guidance, baseline data to support target development can come from bio-behavioral surveys (BBS) and size estimates, especially to understand current PLHIV burden and program results. Use the most recent and reliable estimates available where possible. For example, population size estimates and survey data on knowledge of status can inform PP_PREV and subsequent clinical cascade targets. The COP22 Guidance Section 6.6.2 has substantial guidance on expectations of an effective KP program, and should be reviewed before setting KP targets. Where possible and relevant, use FY22 targets and, as available, results to inform FY23 targets (the Assumption column for each indicator in the tab). But remember to consider expectations for scale-up based on current program needs and gaps. That is, FY21 results may not be the most relevant and appropriate base from which to develop FY23 targets. As per COP22 Guidance, OUs should strive to ensure all KPs reached with KP programming (KP_PREV), who do not already know their HIV status are either tested for HIV or actively referred for HIV testing. Therefore, DataPacks will be reviewed for the relationship between KP_PREV to HTS for KP, and if the relationship is substantially different from one to one, it will be important to discuss rationale and context with Chair and PPM. For clinical cascade indicators (HTS_TST, TX_NEW, etc.), consider the relationship amongst these indicators to ensure rates of linkage to treatment are in alignment with COP22 Guidance (i.e., high rates of linkage across all populations). Recognize that Key Population disaggregates are a SUBSET of the regular Age/Sex disaggregates. Each PSNU must have a total of relevant Age/Sex disaggregates of the same indicator for targeting process to be correct (e.g., 15+ Men for MSM). This is also an important factor to consider on the PSNU x IM tab. You may construct additional formulae in the far right of the tab to check this, but it will also be checked by the validation apps and the KP Validation tab. Therefore we have moved the KP tab earlier in the DataPack, and suggest that you start the KP tab early in the DataPack process, and regularly compare against Cascade, HTS, and PrEP tabs. Also note that IMs that do not provide actual clinical services cannot report TX_NEW or TX_CURR. While those IMs should track linkage in their own data systems, there is no relevant MER indicator for that data. 15.1 KP: KP_ESTIMATES E F G Column Name NA NA NA UID KP_ESTIMATES.Total.T KP_ESTIMATES.Pos.T KP_ESTIMATES.Prev.T Column Type? target target target What type of data? integer integer percentage Prepopulated data?

Review and adjust the Targeted ART Linkage Rate (FY23) (%), which is set at a default of 95% for all OUs. Change this value as needed, however, you must seek permission from your assigned PPM and DUIT Liaisons before decreasing the targeted suppression rate to any value below 95%. Red highlights in this column indicate percentages above 100% or below 0%; yellow highlights indicate percentages that have been altered to drop below 95%. Set HTS_TST Yield (FY23) (%) which will resemble the Yield % that was set in the various modalities of the HTS tab and should be approached similarly. Review modeled FY23 targets for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positive, which are the product of TX_NEW from all other sources (FY23) and the rate set in Targeted ART Linkage Rate (FY23) (%). However, due to wide variation in KP programming, this value can be overwritten and manually adjusted as needed without further approval from PPMs or DUIT Liaisons. Lastly, review the modeled FY23 Targets for HTS_TST KeyPop, Negative, which will be calculated by first dividing the FY23 target for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positive by the Yield set in Step 5, and then subtracting the FY23 target for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positive.

The positivity yield should be between 15 and 40% among adults and there are further requirements for the SGAC accepted proportion of positives coming from the index testing modality. Users should reference the COP 2022 Guidance document for the required parameters based on TX coverage. Review data for what percent of HTS_TST_POS comes from modalities set in other sections or tabs of the DataPack. Note that to adjust these allocations, you must return to the section or tab of the DataPack where these are initially set. Hyperlinks in column headers can help you navigate to the exact column where this occurs. DO NOT adjust allocation percentages for these gray columns in this section of the HTS tab as this will NOT affect any final targets and will break linkages between this tab and source data. These modalities to be reviewed, but adjusted elsewhere include: HTS_INDEX_COM_POS (FY23) HTS_INDEX_FAC_POS (FY23) PMTCT_STAT: New Positives (FY23) HTS_TST PMTCT Post ANC1: Positives (FY23) TB_STAT: New Positives (FY23) VMMC_CIRC: HIV Positive (FY23) Review and adjust planned percentage contributions to HTS_TST_POS from all other HTS modalities, which will initially be populated based on trends seen in FY22 targets, but can be adjusted as needed to align with COP22 - FY23 testing strategies. Note that as you adjust these allocation percentages, the number of projected individuals to be identified HIV positive will change in the corresponding modality block to the right.

See below for additional, detailed instructions. Any cell that is highlighted indicates that it is in a row that users should review the distribution of positives. Review FY23 Targets for individuals to be tested and found HIV negative through PMTCT_STAT, HTS_TST Post ANC1, TB_STAT, and VMMC_CIRC. To adjust these values, follow hyperlinks to the source of data for these columns. Review modeled targets for Total HTS_TST_NEG, Total HTS_TST, and the Aggregate Yield Rate, which is modeled simply by dividing the final HTS_TST_POS total by the total HTS_TST target. 16.4.3 Resolve HTS_TST_POS Rounding Differences In the process of allocating HTS_TST_POS targets across HTS modalities, the multiplication of integer values representing whole people by percentage allocations, followed by rough rounding, often causes slight rounding errors to accumulate across ages, sexes, and geographies. In situations where there may be significantly small HTS_TST_POS targets being spread over multiple HTS modalities, the aggregation of many small rounding errors can lead to large differences in planned and final HTS_TST_POS. This section of the DataPack is built to help identify and resolve these cases, where they occur. Prior to using this section, it is key that all allocations be complete, either in those modalities called out specifically in the Cascade tab, or in the HTS tabs Distribution of Positive Tests section. With this complete, only true rounding error cases will remain to be identified in this section of the DataPack. Cases where rounding errors may have occurred will be highlighted in red formatting in the column titled, HTS_TST_POS difference to adjust; Excel filters may be helpful in narrowing to these rows. By first reviewing and refining allocations in the Cascade tab of the DataPack for overall HTS_INDEX, PMTCT_STAT, HTS_TST PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, and VMMC_CIRC, any rounding errors still present on the HTS tab are more likely the result of distributions decided on this tab across the following modalities: Inpatient (Facility) Pediatric (Facility) Malnutrition (Facility) STI Clinic (Facility) Emergency (Facility) Other PITC (Facility) VCT (Facility) SNS (Facility) Mobile (Community) SNS (Community) Other (Community) The process for resolving rounding errors across these modalities may involve some trial and error. In all cases, but especially for cases where total HTS_TST_POS is small and rounding errors could represent large swings in total targets, it is necessary to determine which modality(ies) should be allocated remainder HTS_TST_POS identified in this section. Iteratively return to the HTS_TST Distribution of Positive Tests section on this HTS tab to adjust allocations, then return to this section to check for lingering rounding remainders. At the culmination of this iterative approach, there should be no values or highlighting remaining in the HTS_TST_POS difference to adjust column of this section. 16.5 HTS: HTS_SELF HTS_SELF (N): Number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed.

To add or remove any SNUs on this list during the COP21 process, notify your assigned PPM, as well as DREAMS liaisons on the PEPFAR Program Quality Team to ensure these changes are reflected in your DataPack. After communicating and documenting these updates centrally, the DataPack Self-Service App will alert to an update in the DREAMS SNU list and provide an updated DataPack with updated data in this DREAMS SNU? column. Note that in the interim, you may manually overwrite or alter flags in this column, though any discrepancies between this column in the DataPack and the centrally-maintained list of DREAMS SNUs will be flagged in the DataPack Self-Service App and must be resolved prior to COP Approval and DATIM import. Review columns FY21 Results and FY22 Targets which will come pre-populated with results and targets from DATIM and will serve as a baseline for COP21 target calculations. Review the column Projected Net Change in OVC_SERV (%), which will be preset with a default rate of 0%. Alter this percent value to either increase or decrease the OVC targets for COP21. Changes in this column will affect the overall OVC_SERV targets reflected in column Total OVC_SERV. Review and adjust the allocation of total OVC_SERV across DREAMS, Preventive, and Comprehensive: For DREAMS, allocations are only allowable where a district is denoted as a DREAMS SNU  to adjust, return to step 2  and for females ages 10 to 17. For Preventive services, allocations are only allowable for adolescents ages 5 to 14. All remaining OVC_SERV is automatically allocated to the Comprehensive service category. Red highlighting in the column, Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV, indicates cases where percentages are over 100% or less 0%. Review and adjust the column Targeted Graduation Rate among Comprehensive (%), which is preset at a default value of 20%, per guidance from O/GAC. Adjust these values as necessary to align with the COP 2021 OVC strategy. Graduation rates can be set at any value between 0-100% but should not be a negative value. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100% or less than 0%; yellow highlights indicate graduation rates less than 20%.

In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in this column. Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted by the DREAMS program COP21 implementation. This target is calculated by multiplying the total OVC_SERV target by the Targeted DREAMS % of Total OVC_SERV (%) (FY23) set in step 5. This formula is also dependent on the input into column DREAMS SNU?, which must be marked with a Y to indicate the SNU is in fact a DREAMS SNU in order to set this target (see step 2). Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted by the OVC Preventive program COP21 implementation. This target is calculated by multiplying the total OVC_SERV target by the Targeted Preventive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) (FY23), set in step 5. Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted for graduation from OVC Comprehensive services during COP21 implementation. This target is a calculated by multiplying the Total OVC_SERV target by the Targeted Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) (FY23) and Targeted Graduation Rate among Comprehensive (%) (FY23). Review the targeted number of Active OVC Comprehensive beneficiaries for COP21. The Active OVC Comprehensive target is derived in the DataPack as a remainder of Total OVC_SERV to be served via Comprehensive services, less those captured in the Comprehensive - Graduated target.

Return to those tabs to investigate and adjust values. Changes made in this section of the KP Validation tab WILL NOT affect actual targets set in those tabs. NOTE: Confirm for PrEP indicators that DREAMS age groups are aligned between KP and Total Populations, and ensure there is sufficient excess to target AGYW demographics. Review each column of the KP Targets Validation section. Data for these columns come originally from the KP tab of the DataPack. Return to that tab to investigate and adjust values. Changes made in this section of the KP Validation tab WILL NOT affect actual targets in the KP tab. Review the FSW column and ensure the total in this column does not exceed the total target for Female, 15+ (FY23). Cases where this does occur will be highlighted red. Review the MSM column and ensure the total in this column does not exceed the total target for Male, 15+ (FY23). Cases where this does occur will be highlighted red. Review the final three columns People in prisons and other enclosed settings, PWID, and TG to ensure that the sum of these three columns does not exceed the remainder of KPs  the remainder after subtracting the amounts targeted in the FSW and MSM columns. Cases where this does occur will be highlighted red.

To receive and populate a DataPack, follow the below instructions. 27.0.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: All mechanism integer value totals All deduplication proportions 27.1 Receiving a PSNU x IM Tab for the First Time Important Note: Adding data to the PSNUxIM tab of your DataPack may cause the the filesize of your DataPack to increase, sometimes significantly. As this may have implications for the performance of your DataPack, it is recommended to run initial validations in the Self-Service App and ensure the DataPack is in a good state of completeness prior to generating the PSNUxIM tab. Although the App will give the option to generate the PSNUxIM tab each time you validate your tool, it is not required to complete this step until you are fully prepared to begin the mechanism allocation process. Upon first receipt, the DataPack will not contain a populated PSNU x IM tab. To receive a populated version of this tab, follow the below instructions: Submit a preliminary DataPack for validation to the self-service validation tool at datapack.DATIM.org. The DataPack Self-Service App will automatically detect that the PSNU x IM tab has not yet been populated and will do so, returning a new copy of the DataPack with all other parts of the DataPack left unaltered, but containing a populated PSNU x IM tab. Note that this new copy of your DataPack will NOT automatically update any data derived from DATIM used across the rest of the DataPack, such as previous years result or target data. To request a DataPack with updated DATIM data, contact your PPM and assigned DUIT Liaison for approval, then submit a ticket to the DataPack Support Team at DATIM.Zendesk.com. Download the new copy of your DataPack generated by the Self-Service App and make it available to the rest of your team as appropriate. Review the initial PSNU x IM tab for any obvious errors made in the automated generation process. Flag any issues to the DataPack Support Team at DATIM.Zendesk.com. In producing a PSNU x IM tab for the first time, the DataPack Self-Service app will write data and formulas into this tab as follows: Each PSNU, with its parent SNU1. DataPack Indicator Codes, which reference codes used throughout the DataPack hidden in row 14 of on each tab. Age, Sex, &amp; Key Population for each sub-population, where specified. Total DataPack Targets, as set in previous tabs of the DataPack. In adding these targets, the DataPack Self-Service App will write formulas allowing dynamic referencing of each target. In cases where additional updates to previous tabs of the DataPack may be necessary, any updates to target values will automatically be updated on this tab in this column. Rollup totals, summing allocated targets across all mechanisms. This column can be helpful in quickly assessing whether DataPack Target totals have been over- or under-allocated across DSD or TA, and IMs. Red highlighting indicates cases where Rollup sums differ from original DataPack Target totals. Percentage allocations across IMs and DSD or TA, based on FY21 Target proportions as currently reported in DATIM. Note that these are based on a snapshot of DATIM taken at the time this data is originally written into the PSNU x IM tab. These allocation percentages will not automatically update once they have been first written into this tab. See below for how to either adjust existing allocations, or add new IMs and allocations to this section. Possible maximum and minimum Deduplicated Rollup Totals, Deduplicated DSD Totals, and Deduplicated TA Totals. Observed and Targeted Dedupe Resolution strategies as seen in DATIM-reported data for FY21 Targets, or based on allocations chosen in the DataPack. See below for additional information. Duplicated Rollups, summing by DSD, TA, and Total across all allocated mechanisms. These data will automatically update as allocations are adjusted on this tab, or as total targets are adjusted on other tabs. IM-level Target Values, as integers, calculated by multiplying DataPack Target totals by mechanism allocation percentages. 27.2 Adjusting IM Allocations To adjust, remove, and add allocations across Mechanisms in the PSNU x IM tab, follow the below instructions: Review initial allocations written automatically into the DataPack based on patterns observed in FY21 Targets in DATIM. To adjust existing percentages, type over percentages already provided in the DataPack with new percentages reflecting COP21 strategic programming. Note that these allocations are both to distribute targets to mechanisms as well as to distribute them across DSD and TA. In other words, in a case with no deduplication, allocations should sum to 100%, representing how each target will be divided both across mechanisms and by service type. To remove existing percentages, DO NOT DELETE COLUMNS. Instead, either replace the name of a mechanism in row 14 with a new name (following the format #####_DSD or #####_TA) and repurpose or replace the allocations in the rows below it, or delete all percentage allocations for a given mechanism  but keeping the mechanism name in row 14 the same  effectively withdrawing it from a certain geography or population or program area. To add new mechanisms for allocation, follow the below steps: Unhide the buffer of hidden green columns between pre-populated mechanism columns and the gray columns to the right describing Deduplicated Totals (Columns K  CG). Type the new mechanism name into the green cell in row 14, making sure to also denote the service type, whether DSD or TA. These names must be of the format: #####_DSD, or #####_TA. Do not leave any blank columns between mechanisms. Again, DO NOT DELETE COLUMNS. Confirm that mechanisms added here are entered in FACTS Info, approved, and valid for MER data entry for COP21. While there can be up to a 24 hour delay in synchronizing these mechanisms from FACTS Info to DATIM, as soon as a mechanism is added and approved and valid in FACTS Info, its 4-6 digit numeric code can be entered here in the DataPack, and you can begin allocating targets to this new mechanism. However, note that in order to validate these data using the DataPack Self-Service App, mechanisms must have already been synchronized from FACTS Info to DATIM. Validation alerts in the DataPack Self-Service App will note where this may not be the case. Add allocations in the rows below any new mechanisms, making sure that new and old allocations still aggregate to no less than 100% allocation in all cases, and also no more than 100% allocation where no deduplication occurs. 27.3 Resolving Invalid Mechanism Errors The PNSUxIM tab will only populate with mechanisms that are marked as active for the current COP year in DATIM. Any mechanisms that are manually added by the user to to the PSNUxIM tab that are not active and valid will be flagged by the self-service app every time the user validates their tool. To ensure a mechanism is valid for the current COP year, go into the COP module in FACTS Info-Next Gen (FI-NG) and check the box for PEPFAR Systems Active Reporting Years for the appropriate COP year. Please note that it may take up to a day for active mechanism flags to be carried over into DATIM and clear up validation errors in the self-service app. 27.4 Note on Peace Corps Mechanisms For the COP21 planning cycle, Peace Corps will transition from reporting targets under their older mechanisms to reporting all targets under the Management &amp; Operations (M&amp;O) mechanisms. Note that the PSNUxIM tab will initially populate mechanisms and distributions based on previous year targets, so users must shift their Peace Corps targets to M&amp;O mechanisms from their previous mechanisms by changing the IM reference number at the top of the tab to the appropriate M&amp;O IM reference number. 27.5 Resolving Rounding Errors Due to the combination of multiplication of percentage values against target values coming from other parts of the DataPack, and rounding of all mechanism target values to integers, target values allocated against mechanisms may roll up with some slight difference from DataPack Targets. It may be necessary to iteratively adjust rounding errors and deduplications throughout the IM allocation process, though in general it is a good practice to resolve rounding errors as much as possible before moving on to deduplication. To resolve rounding errors, adjust percentages gradually, as follows: If you had previously unhid the buffer of green Percentage Allocation columns (the section between columns K and CG) while adding new mechanisms, or the Deduplication columns in columns CH to DB, it may be helpful to hide columns in these sections again now to more easily see both Percentage Allocations and Target Values at the same time on your screen. It may also be helpful to review Duplicated Rollup values in columns DC to DE in addition to DataPack Targets in column I so as to consider rounding errors distinctly from the impacts of deduplication. Note that all when first produced, the PSNUxIM tab applies no initial deduplication, so Total Duplicated Rollups and DataPack Targets will match when first received. While maintaining overall distribution patterns as intended, gradually adjust percentage allocations under affected mechanisms in columns K through CG to increase or decrease Duplicated Rollups as needed. Note that while all rounding errors should be resolved if possible, a small margin of error around some values is permissible, so long as this does not exceed an absolute value of 2 in either direction of the DataPack Target in column I. 27.6 Performing Deduplication Follow the below steps to perform all Deduplication associated with IM allocations of targets. Note that due to improvements to the COP21 DataPack and close alignment with DATIM, performing deduplications in the DataPack resolves the need to perform any deduplication in DATIM. If you had previously unhid the buffer of green Percentage Allocation columns (columns K  CG), it may be helpful to hide empty columns in this section again now. Review Duplicated Rollups for DSD, TA, and total targets, beginning in column DC. These are dynamically summed across all mechanism targets allocated in the PSNU x IM tab to the right of these columns. To adjust these totals, return to the Percentage Allocation section. Review TA Deduplication in columns CV to DB, DSD Deduplication in columns CO to CU, and Crosswalk Deduplication in columns CH to CN (recommended in that order for each row): Where only a single mechanism is assigned targets under either DSD or TA (for DSD and TA Deduplication), where deduplicated DSD and TA totals (see column CH) aggregate to less than or equal to DataPack targets (for Crosswalk Deduplication), or where total mechanism targets (column DC) aggregate to less than or equal to DataPack Targets (column I), gray highlighting in these sections indicates that deduplication is not necessary or permitted. Review allowable ranges for possible deduplicated totals by referencing the SUM and MAX rollup columns. As in the DATIM Deduplication App, SUM values represent cases with zero deduplication, and MAX rollups represent application of the most deduplication possible, resulting in values equivalent to the largest IM target among either the DSD or TA mechanisms (for DSD or TA deduplication), or the larger of either DSD or TA deduplicated totals (for crosswalk deduplication). Review Observed Dedupe Resolutions seen in FY21 Target allocations. These are provided for reference, and indicate which deduplication approach was used in FY21 Target deduplication, performed in the DATIM Deduplication App. For cases where Custom deduplication was used in FY21 Targets, review the Custom Dedupe Allocation observed in FY21 Targets. Percentages here are calculated by dividing the DSD or TA deduplication value (for DSD or TA deduplication) or the sum of Deduplicated DSD and Deduplicated TA (for crosswalk deduplication) by the sum of all mechanisms and deduplication values, across both DSD and TA. As such, these values are all negative or zero, and can be easily compared against target allocation percentages used in columns K  CG. In columns CZ for TA, CS for DSD, and CL for Crosswalk, manually type the deduplication resolution approach to be used to resolve deduplication issues, as follows: CUSTOM or custom or Custom SUM or sum or Sum MAX or max or Max Where Custom deduplication is selected, also indicate the percentage allocation to be assigned to the deduplication value in the column to the immediate right. Again, a reminder that these values should all be negative or zero, and represent the proportion of deduplication values relative to the DataPack Target total in column I. Initially upon indicating Custom deduplication, the DataPack will preset this deduplication allocation equal to the value observed in FY21 Targets, if any. You may alter and adjust this value as needed, so long as it is negative or zero. Also note that it is not enough to only type in a percentage deduplication allocation; you must also enter CUSTOM, SUM, or MAX, as explained in the previous step. Note that instead of entering SUM, it is possible to enter CUSTOM but enter a deduplication percentage allocation of 0%; and instead of entering MAX, it is possible to enter CUSTOM but enter a deduplication percentage allocation that results in the equivalent of the MAX value shown in columns CI, CP, or CW. Review the Rollup values in column J for any mismatch against DataPack Targets in column I that may necessitate adjustment of Deduplication allocations. Note that while it is not a strict requirement that percentage allocations across mechanisms and deduplication add to 100%, it is a requirement that integer values add to equal the DataPack Target in column I, ± 2. Red highlights in column J indicate values more than 2 (integer, absolute value) away from the DataPack Targets in column I; yellow highlights indicate values 1 or 2 (integer, absolute value) away from the DataPack Targets column I.

After logging into the app, you can upload a copy of your DataPack, and receive feedback regarding the structure and content of the DataPack. The app will attempt to provide feedback regarding any errors which may prevent the import of your DataPack into DATIM. In general, all errors must be resolved prior to any approval or import of data into DATIM. Warning messages should be carefully reviewed. While these may not prevent import of your data, ignoring them may lead to data quality problems. The app also provides a number of charts and tables to assist with review of your DataPack. Each of these functions will be described in more detail in the remained of this chapter. 28.1 Logging in In order to access the app, you will need to login with your DATIM credentials. If you do not have a DATIM username and password or if your account has been deactivated, please contact DATIM support. 28.2 Uploading a DataPack Once you have logged into the app, choose Browse from the left side pane. Select the DataPack you wish to validate. Please be sure to use an XLSX file! Other formats such as XLSB or ZIP archives of your DataPack are not supported, and cannot be used. Once you file is completely uploaded to the server, the Validate button should become active. 28.3 Validating your DataPack After pressing the Validate button on the left-side pane, the app will perform a number of structural checks on your file. It is critical that the structure of the DataPack matches that which was provided to you. Any tabs or columns which have been removed will result in a parsing error, and these will need to be fixed prior to import. Other checks include: Altered formulas: Generally, formulas should not be altered, but there can be valid programmatic reasons for doing so. These warnings are provided in order to allow those reviewing the DataPack to make a determination as to whether they are valid changes or not. Decimal values: In general, all values (with a few exceptions) should be whole integer numbers. Decimals cannot be imported into DATIM, and thus must be rounded prior to import. This can lead to variations in the numbers which are visible in the DataPack and those which are imported into DATIM. Negative numbers: In general, all numbers in the DataPack should be whole, positive integers. Non-numeric values: Any values which are not numeric, e.g. characters, is not allowed. Imbalanced PSNUxIM distribution: When distributing data from the main DataPack tabs, to the PSNUxIM tab, small varations due to rounding may result. As an example, if a target of 100 has been set in the main tab, and is then distributed evenly between three partners, each with a target value of 33, a value of 1 remains undistributed. To avoid this situation you may need to use allocation targets of 34%,34%,32% instead, which would ensure that the values allocated in the PSNUxIM tab match those in the main programmatic area tabs. Threaded comments: This type of comment, as opposed to the previous type of Notes used in Microsoft Excel, causes corruption issues when the app attempts to update your PSNUxIM tab. Prior to submitting for an updated PSNUxIM tab, you MUST remove all threaded comments. For more information about the differences between threaded comments and notes visit this link. Duplicated rows: There should be no duplicated rows in any of the main tabs or the PSNUxIM tab. Invalid organisation units: All PSNUs referened in the DataPack must exist in DATIM. Missing metadata: Certain columns such as the PSNU, Indicator code, Age, Sex and KeyPop columns must always be present. If any of these values is for some reason missing, please find the location of the error and fix the issue. 28.4 Validation rule checks Validation rules provide additional data quality controls between certain indicators. As a simple example, the number of persons testing positive for HIV should be less than or equal to the number of individuals tested. Under most circumstances, validation rules should not be violated, but there can be certain programmatic reasons why these violations should be waived. A number of rules have been created, and many of them are enforced in the DataPack itself. However, not all rules have been implemented in the DataPack, and due to formula changes and subtleties in how targets are allocated at the PSNUxIM level, additional review of the data in the PSNUxIM tab and main tabs may be required. During the validation of the datapack, all data contained in the PSNUxIM tab will be checked against all of the validation rules defined in DATIM. If there are any violations of the validation rules, the app will provide detailed feedback in regards to which PSNUxIM combination is affected. In order to resolve these, you will need to carefully review how the PNSUxIM allocations have been made to respective mechanisms in the PSNUxIM tab. While validation rule violations will not prevent the import of your data into DATIM, they may lead to data quality problems in both DATIM and downstream systems such as Panorama and PAW. If there are any validation rule issues, your PPM and DUIT can be requested to waive these at their discreation. 28.5 Analytics checks Analytics checks provide an additional type of data quality control. As an example, one analytics check looks for VMMC indeterminate rates greater than 5 percent. Ideally, the indeterminate rate should be a low as possible, but if for some reason targets have been set where the rate is greater than 5 %, the app will inform you about the specific PSNUxIM where this occurs. Again, these flags will not prevent the import of your data into DATIM, but are provided to help reviewers to make a determination regarding the approval of the DataPack for import. The app will provide a list of all analytics checks which have been flagged in the Analytics checks tab on the right side of the app pane. 28.6 Indicator summary This table provides a high-level SNU level summary of indicators from each of the main tabs of the DataPack. Note, that this data is NOT drawn from the PSNUxIM tab. This can be a useful first check of your DataPack, prior to the allocation of the data in the PSNUxIM tab. 28.7 SNUlevel summary This table listing provides all of the data from each of the main DataPack tabs summarized by the SNU level. 28.8 Validation rules This tab provides a listing of all validation rule violations, if any. The table provides the following fields PSNU: The specific PSNU where the violation occurs Mechanism: The specific mechanism where the violation occurs. Formula: The rule is specified with a left side, a right side, and an operator. The left and right side correspond to a data element (or data elements) located in the PSNUxIM tab. Using a combination of filters (PSNU, Mechanism and Data elemement), you should be able to locate the specific rows in the PSNUxIM tab which are leading to the validation rule violation. Diff (%) : Provides the percentage difference between the left and right side. Diff (Absolute) : Provides the numeric difference between the left and right side.
