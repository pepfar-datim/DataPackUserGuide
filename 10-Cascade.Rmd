# CASCADE

The Cascade Tab allows DataPack users to view and set the overall
contour of their treatment and testing program across both geography and
population. Of all tabs in the COP22 DataPack, this tab experienced the
most changes compared to the COP21 DataPack, reflecting changes in
PEPFAR COP guidance to reemphasize the importance of Viral Load Testing
Coverage (VLC) and Viral Load Suppression (VLS) in the HIV response.

As seen in Section 7 of PEPFAR COP/ROP 2022 Guidance, Country Teams are
asked to center their COP22 discussions around the concept of Population
Viral Load Suppression (PopVLS), or the percent of all People Living
with HIV who have a suppressed viral load (see also "Consolidated
Strategic Information Guidelines for HIV in the Health Sector", WHO:
Geneva, May 2015, pp 149-151; "Consolidated HIV Strategic Information
Guidelines: Driving Impact through Programme Monitoring and Management",
WHO: Geneva, April 2020, pp 56-57). This metric provides a succinct,
composite view of the HIV reponse, including: new infections, testing &
diagnosis, linkage to and retention on treatment, eligibility for viral
load testing, roll out of viral load testing, and viral load
suppression.

The DataPack's Cascade tab similarly centers itself around PopVLS, and
applies dynamic logic to support target setting in geographies and
populations that are near or at epidemic control, as well those that are
further from this goal. This is made possible by incorporating, for the
first time, explicit consideration of new infections across the Cascade
tab, as well as enhanced consideration of those who were previously
infected but not linked to ART.

As in past DataPacks, this tab interweaves with many other tabs of the
DataPack, including the PMTCT, TB, EID, VMMC, KP, HTS, CXCA, HTS_RECENT,
and TX_TB_PREV tabs. As is explained below and in sections related to
these tabs, DataPack logic is most useful when target-setting begins in
the Cascade tab and progresses from left to right, both within that tab,
and across and within all other tabs, returning iteratively to the
Cascade tab throughout.

## Host Country Context

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-Host Country Context-F-I-1-5", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-Host Country Context-J-M-2-5", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-Host Country Context-N-P-3-5", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-Host Country Context-Q-S-4-5", "latex")

```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-Host Country Context-F-Y-1-1", "html")
```

For those leveraging UNAIDS Spectrum estimate exports for the Data Pack,
once these have been loaded into the Spectrum tab of the Data Pack, this
first portion of the Cascade tab will automatically update to reflect
these estimates. For those leveraging alternatives to Spectrum, see
below.

In specific, the Host Country Context section of the Cascade tab
provides space for reflecting the following data:

-   **Host Country Estimated Population (FY22)** $POP\_EST.T\_1$:
    Estimated population, projected as of September 2022.

-   **Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY22)** $PLHIV.T\_1$: Estimated
    number of people living with HIV, projected as of September 2022.

-   **Host Country Estimated HIV Prevalence (FY22) (%)**
    $HIV\_PREV.T\_1$: Estimated HIV Prevalence, projected as of
    September 2022.

-   **Host Country Projected Incidence Rate (FY22) (%)**
    $Incidence_SUBNAT.Rt.T_1$: Estimated incidence rate, projected as of
    September 2022.

-   **Host Country Projected New Infections (FY23)**
    $NEW_INFECTIONS_SUBNAT.T_1$: Estimated new infections projected to
    occur in FY23, based on projected FY22 Incidence Rates.

-   **Host Country PLHIV Diagnosed (FY22)** $DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.T_1$:
    Estimated number of people living with HIV who know their HIV
    status, projected as of September 2022.

-   **Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY21)**
    $TX\_CURR\_SUBNAT.R$: Observed/actual total number of PLHIV
    receiving ART as of September 2021.

-   **Host Country Estimated TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22)**
    $TX\_CURR\_SUBNAT.T\_1$: Estimated number of PLHIV receiving ART,
    projected as of September 2022.

-   **Host Country Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY22)**
    $VL_TESTING_SUBNAT.T_1$: Estimated number of ART Patients who have
    been tested for Viral Load Suppression, projected as of
    September 2022. \**See note below*

-   **Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22)**
    $VL_SUPPRESSED.T_1$: Estimated people living with HIV who are on ART
    and have a suppressed viral load, projected as of September 2022.
    \**See note below*

\**Note:* These two columns have been added and left blank for country
teams to add in data, should they have reliable Host Country Data
available to them. Should a team have access to this data, they should
consult their PPM and DUIT Liaison prior to populating the columns. If a
country does not have good Host Country Data VL data, the best way
forward is likely to leave blank, and the DataPack will work with your
PEPFAR TX_PVLS data on it's own.

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section,
replacing any preexisting estimates for these indicators that may have
already been entered in DATIM:

-   **Host Country Estimated Population (FY22)** $POP_EST.T_1$
-   **Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY22)** $PLHIV.T_1$
-   **Host Country Estimated HIV Prevalence (FY22) (%)** $HIV_PREV.T_1$
-   **Host Country PLHIV Diagnosed (FY22)** $DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.T_1$
-   **Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY21)** $TX_CURR_SUBNAT.R$
-   **Host Country Estimated TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22)**
    $TX_CURR_SUBNAT.T_1$
-   **Host Country Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY22)**
    $VL_TESTING_SUBNAT.T_1$
-   **Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22)**
    $VL_SUPPRESSED.T_1$

### Instructions

1.  If using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data:

    a.  Review the above columns to confirm that data has been correctly
        linked with the Spectrum tab. You may consider using filter
        drop-down menus to quickly inspect for any non-numeric,
        negative, or invalid data.

    b.  Review Relative Standard Error values to identify any estimates
        with a Relative Standard Error of more than or equal to 20. See
        the section below for additional instructions.

2.  If leveraging alternatives to UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for
    these data, see the below section.

3.  Confirm that no data has been entered against \_Military
    Organization Units. See below for more explanation.

### Leveraging Alternatives to Spectrum

Most countries are encouraged to use UNAIDS Spectrum as their source for
the above data. However, Country Teams may request approval from their
PPM and a DUIT Liaison to use an alternative data source if deemed more
reliable.

In this case, paste estimates from other approved sources into this
section of the Cascade tab by overwriting the formulas currently in
these green columns. Due to hidden Relative Standard Error columns
between the various estimate columns, it is recommended you paste this
data in one column at a time, rather than in bulk. It may also reduce
technical issues to first copy geographic data in the SNU1, PSNU, Age,
and Sex columns into a separate spreadsheet, then use Excel lookup
functions to add estimates data against the correct geographies and
populations, and then return to pasting data into the original Cascade
tab column by column.

### Relative Standard Errors

UNAIDS Spectrum estimates are accompanied by Relative Standard Errors
(RSE) for each data point, both at the District level as well as the
Age/Sex-specific level. These indicate the relative reliability of each
of these data, which should be considered when using these to make
program planning decisions.

Along with the data points above, RSEs will also automatically be
populated in the Cascade tab from data loaded into the Spectrum tab.
While initially these RSE columns will be hidden, you can unhide these
columns to inspect these values. RSEs are also used to color-coded
related columns based on the relative uncertainty of each specific data
point as follows:

-   **Red:** RSE ≥ 40.

-   **Yellow:** RSE \< 40, but ≥ 20.

-   **Green:** RSE \< 20.

Red or yellow highlighting may not always mean a data point should be
disregarded, nor is it the case that all green values should be taken at
face value. Either way, consider these RSEs as helpful guideposts in
interpreting the contextual meaning and quality of UNAIDS Spectrum
estimates.

If, in reviewing Relative Standard Error values, the uncertainty
interval of an estimate appears to be concerning, consider the following
next steps:

1.  Raise and discuss the issue with your PPM and DUIT Liaison.

2.  Communicate concerns to assigned UNAIDS liaisons and discuss
    appropriate methods for improving or better understanding data
    quality for the data points in question.

### Host Country Estimates for Military Organization Units

Due to issues of political sensitivity and national security, estimates
for the above indicators should not be entered against Military
Organization Units. Any case where this does occur will be flagged in
the Data Pack Self-Service App, and removed during DATIM import.

## PEPFAR FY21 Cascade (Observed) & PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Planned)

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-PEPFAR FY21 Cascade (Observed)-Z-AD-1-1", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-PEPFAR FY21 Cascade (Observed)-Z-AD-1-1", "html")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Planned)-AE-AI-1-1", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Planned)-AE-AI-1-1", "html")
```

This section provides an overview of PEPFAR FY21 results and FY22
targets, both to give insight into the current status of PEPFAR's
contribution to the host country HIV response, as well to serve as
reference to many other sections in the Cascade tab. Review this section
to understand PEPFAR's trends for the following data, as well as the
linkages and relationships between them:

-   New Positives --- including from both HTS_TST_POS (serologic
    testing) & PMTCT_HEI_POS (virologic testing)

-   TX_NEW

-   TX_CURR

-   TX_PVLS (D)

-   TX_PVLS (N)

## VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT-AJ-AN-1-1", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT-AJ-AN-1-1", "html")
```

This section of the Cascade tab builds upon the preceding Host Country
Context and PEPFAR Cascade sections to arrive at an analysis of gap to
PopVLS by geography and population. The distance between the current
estimated PopVLS rate and the targeted PopVLS rate helps DataPack users
simulate the number of individuals to be added into the pool of virally
suppressed PLHIV.

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23)** $VL_SUPPRESSED.T$

### Instructions

1.  Review historic PEPFAR and Host Country data to understand existing
    trends by geography and population.

2.  Review the estimated PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response for FY22,
    and adjust the planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response for FY23.
    See below.

3.  Review baseline Working PopVLS Rate for FY22. This is estimated from
    Host Country PLHIV estimates and either Host Country VLS data, if
    available, or extrapolated from PEPFAR VLS data otherwise.

4.  Review and adjust the Planned PopVLS Rate for FY23. See below for
    additional information

5.  Review resulting **VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT**. See below for additional
    information.

### PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response

While PEPFAR's contribution to the HIV response within the Host Country
may vary across areas of that response, this column attempts to
summarize this contribution for use in modeling subsequent targets.

The DataPack first attempts to describe PEPFAR's contribution during
FY22, based on both Host Country estimates as well as PEPFAR Results and
Targets. Keep in mind as you review these data that the methodologies
used in producing Host Country estimates may produce artificial
discrepancies between PEPFAR and Host Country values. For example, if
Host Country estimates are produced from household surveys, these
residential-centric data may differ significantly from PEPFAR's data,
which are largely collected at point of service. (Because of this, it is
recommended that Host Country estimates follow a point-of-service model
where possible.)

In the following column, adjust values to reflect PEPFAR's planned
contribution to the HIV response. Keep in mind that if PEPFAR's FY21
results or FY22 targets are greater than Host Country Estimates for a
given geography of population, it may be wise to maintain this same
relationship to avoid depressing treatment and testing values set later
in the Cascade tab beyond what would be the result of projected
retention rates.

### Working & Planned PopVLS Rates

One of the most pivotal data points in the Data Pack is the baseline
estimate of the Host Country PopVLS Rate. To calculate the estimated ---
or, Working --- PopVLS Rate for FY22 (i.e., projected as of September
2022), the Data Pack may use a variety data points, depending on data
availability for a given geography and population.

In all cases, the denominator of this calculation is the estimated
PLHIV, making it critical that this data be added to the Data Pack in
the Host Country Context section.

For its numerator, the DataPack first attempts to use Host Country
estimates of the total number of Virally Suppressed ART Patients
(VL_SUPPRESSED.T_1):

```{=tex}
\begin{center}

$\frac{Host\ Country\ Est.\ Virally\ Suppressed\ ART\ Patients\ (FY22)}{Host\ Country\ Est.\ PLHIV\ (FY22)}$ 

\end{center}
```
Where these Host Country data are unavailable, the DataPack references
PEPFAR data for TX_PVLS (N) either from FY22 targets or, if these are
also unavailable, FY21 results, and then extrapolates these to the Host
Country context by referencing the Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV
Response set previously.

```{=tex}
\begin{center} $\frac{PEPFAR\ TX\_ CURR\ (FY20\ Results)}{Host\ Country\ Est.\ PLHIV\ (FY21)}$ \end{center}
```
Reviewing and understanding the Working PopVLS Rate arrived at in this
column is critical for much of the rest of the Data Pack. In particular,
this column is immediately used to inform the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23)
in the next column. While the default in this column is 95% x 95% x 95%,
reflecting the UNAIDS "95 for All" goals, where the baseline Working
PopVLS Rate is higher, this will be favored instead. The distance
between the FY23 Planned and FY22 Working PopVLS Rates are instrumental
in determining the following key data points throughout the remainder of
the Cascade Tab:

-   Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT

-   PEPFAR TX_PVLS (N)

-   PEPFAR TX_PVLS (D)

-   PEPFAR TX_NEW

-   PEPFAR TX_CURR

-   PEPFAR TX_CURR_SUBNAT

-   PEPFAR HTS_TST totals

No matter the starting default for Planned PopVLS Rate, you may adjust
this target to fit the realities of your country context and the
strategy of your treatment program. It may also be helpful to leave this
column's defaults to begin, then return to adjust it iteratively as you
proceed through the next few sections of the DataPack and see how this
rate impacts targets.

NOTE: The Data Pack will not prevent situations resulting in PopVLS Rate
exceeding 100% in a given PSNU, but will flag these cases in Red to
highlight when it occurs. Given that these may be a common occurrence in
cases of urban PSNUs, they are allowable in the Data Pack, though should
be coordinated with PPMs and DUIT Liaisons.

### VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT

VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) is set as follows (rounded to the nearest
integer):

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${VL\_ SUPPRESSION\_ SUBNAT}_{t}\  = \ ({PLHIV}_{t-1}\  \times \ \ Planned\ PopVLS\ Rate$ \end{center}
```
As is evident here, targeted VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT is set as a function
of FY22 estimated PLHIV plus the New Infections projected for FY23. How
these projected New Infections specifically impact PEPFAR targets for
TX_NEW, HTS_TST_POS, and TX_CURR will be explained in subsequent
sections.

### \_Military Organization Units

Due to sensitivities around PopVLS estimates for Military organization
units and populations, this data will not be reflected here in the Data
Pack. Country Teams should coordinate closely with Department of Defense
liaisons who will perform a similar analysis based on available data
sources and then directly paste resulting TX_PVLS (N) targets against
the Military organization unit, overwriting the formulas in the TX_PVLS
(N) column described in the next section.

## TX_PVLS (N)

**TX_PVLS (N):** Number of ART patients with suppressed VL results
(\<1,000 copies/mL) documented in the medical or laboratory results/LIS
within the past 12 months.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-TX_PVLS (N)-AU-AW-1-1", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-TX_PVLS (N)-AU-AW-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_PVLS (N): Routine (FY23)** $TX\_PVLS.N.Routine.T$

### Instructions

1.  Filter out both \<01 year olds and \_Military organization units.
    See below for additional steps for these groups.

2.  Review FY23 TX_PVLS (N) Routine targets. To make initial
    adjustments, return to the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23), Planned
    PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response (FY23), New Infections (FY23),
    and PLHIV (FY22). However, at this stage, it is recommended to leave
    defaults for these in place and review modeled targets for TX_PVLS
    (N), TX_PVLS (D), TX_NEW, and TX_CURR, paying special attention to
    TX_NET_NEW (FY23), which will be explained further in the TX_CURR
    section below.

3.  Unfilter \_Military organization units and coordinate with DOD SI so
    they can paste TX_PVLS (N) targets here. In doing so, they may need
    to adjust targets in other PSNUs as well. See below for additional
    information.

### TX_PVLS (N): Routine (FY23)

For both TX_PVLS (N) and TX_PVLS (D), targets are set in the Data Pack
only for Routine viral load testing.

TX_PVLS (N) targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows,
rounded to the nearest integer:

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${TX\_ PVLS.N.Routine}_{t}\  = \ {TX\_ PVLS.D.Routine}_{t}\  \times \ \text{Targeted\ VL\ Suppression\ Rate}_{t}$ \end{center}
```
### \_Military Organization Units

Due to the sensitive nature of DOD support for foreign government
Military organization units, DOD SI teams model and set PSNU-level
targets for TX_PVLS (N) separately so they can leverage granular data
collected in their protected systems. DOD SI liaisons have authority to
overwrite formulas so as to paste targets for Military organization
units in the TX_PVLS (N) column of the Data Pack. As needed, they also
have permission to coordinate with other interagency representatives to
adjust assumptions and targets in other organization units in order to
accommodate \_Military organization unit targets, which are effectively
a cross-section subset of targets across all other PSNUs.

### Infants Virally Suppressed

Targets for \<01 year olds who are virally suppressed are set and
modeled separately from all other age groups as an extension of the
PMTCT model used on the PMTCT tab of the Data Pack. These are initially
set without sex disaggregation on the EID tab of the Data Pack, then
equally allocated by male and female to be reflected on the Cascade Tab.
As such, it is recommended that \<01 year olds be filtered out while
working through the remaining sections of this Cascade tab, and reviewed
here in the Cascade Tab only once targets on the PMTCT and EID tabs have
been fully reviewed.

## TX_PVLS (D)

**TX_PVLS (D):** Number of ART patients with a Viral Load (VL) result
documented in the medical or laboratory records/laboratory information
system (LIS) within the past 12 months.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-TX_PVLS (D)-AM-AO-1-1", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-TX_PVLS (D)-AM-AO-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY23)** $TX\_PVLS.D.Routine.T$

### Instructions

1.  In preparation for setting assumptions for the FY23 Planned VLS
    Rate, review Host Country estimates and PEPFAR results and targets
    for trends in VLS rates for each PSNU and population. This can be
    done in the Data Pack in this section, as well as in PAW, DATIM, and
    Panorama. Yellow highlights in these columns indicate where VLS
    rates have historically been below the UNAIDS goal of 95%, and red
    highlights indicate where reported data produces VLS rates above
    100%.

2.  Review and adjust the FY23 Planned VLS Rate. This defaults to 95%,
    unless historic Host Country or PEPFAR data shows a higher trend.
    However, you may adjust these as needed. In many cases, it is
    recommended to leave modeled assumptions in place and review targets
    through to the TX_CURR section of this tab, paying special attention
    to TX_NET_NEW, and then return to this and other assumptions to
    adjust iteratively.

3.  Review TX_PVLS (D) targets for routine viral load testing. See below
    for additional information.

### TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY23)

As mentioned above, only Routine Viral Load testing will be targeted in
the Data Pack. Within the Data Pack, TX_PVLS (D) targets for Routine
Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer:

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${TX\_ PVLS.D.Routine}_{t}\  = \ \lbrack({TX\_ NEW}_{t}\  \times \ {\%\ TX\_ NEW\ eligible\ for\ VL\ Testing}_{t})\  + \ {TX\_ CURR}_{t - 1}\rbrack\  \times \ {\%\ Access\ to\ VL\ Testing}_{t}$ \end{center}
```
## VLT Coverage

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-VLT Coverage-AV-AY-1-4", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-VLT Coverage-AZ-BC-2-4", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-VLT Coverage-BD-BG-3-4", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-VLT Coverage-BH-BL-4-4", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-VLT Coverage-AV-BL-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

No Targets will be imported to DATIM from this section.

### Instructions

1.  Filter to exclude \<01 year olds.
2.  In preparation for setting targets for **diagnosis rates** for both
    New Infections and those previously Undiagnosed, review historic
    Host Country estimates of the percent of PLHIV with known HIV
    Status, and the number of PLHIV who were previously Undiagnosed.
    Yellow highlights indicate where diagnosis rates appear to be lower
    than the UNAIDS goal of 95%.
3.  Review and adjust the P**lanned Percent of New Infections to be
    Diagnosed in FY23**. Return to the projected New Infections (FY23)
    column in the Host Country Context section of this tab to add or
    adjust New Infections and Incidence Rates as needed. Planned
    diagnosis rates here default to 95%, unless historic Host Country
    trends have been higher. In either case, you may adjust this
    assumption as appropriate.
4.  Review historic data about diagnosis rates, and adjust the **FY23
    Targeted Linkage Rate**, which applies both to New Infections and
    those Previously Infected who are not yet on ART including
    Undiagnosed and those Previously Diagnosed but not on ART). Note
    that Linkage Rates set here are *also* applied to the models used on
    the PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs in order to maintain linkages between
    TX_NEW, PMTCT_ART, TB_ART, and VMMC testing's linkage to treatment.
5.  Adjust the **Percent of Recently Initiated on ART who are planned to
    be Eligible for VLT during FY23**. Keep in mind that per MER
    guidance, individuals must have been on ART for at least 3 months to
    be eligible for VLT. As such, the default in this column is 70%,
    though can be adjusted as needed. Also note that this eligibility
    rate applies to all those planned to be initiated on ART during
    FY23, whether treatment naive (New Infections, Previously
    Undiagnosed, or Previously Diagnosed), or those Returning to
    Treatment.
6.  Review historic data about VLT coverage, and adjust the **FY23
    Planned VLT Coverage Rate**. This rate defaults to 95%, though can
    be adjusted as needed.
7.  Coordinate with DOD SI Liaisons to paste targets for **FY23 New
    Infections Initiated on ART**, overwriting formulas as needed, and
    adjusting upstream assumptions for other organization units as
    needed to reflect the cross-section of DOD targets.
8.  Review FY23 targets modeled for **New Infections Initiated on ART**,
    **Previous Infections to be Initiated on ART**, and the **Total
    Initiated on ART**. See below for additional detail.
9.  Review targets for the FY23 planned **Total Eligible for VLT**. See
    below for additional detail.
10. Review the **FY23 Final Planned VLT Coverage**, which may differ
    from planned VLT Coverage Rates set in the steps above.
    Discrepancies can be traced to assumptions set earlier for the
    PopVLS Rate, the PEPFAR Contribution to the Host Country HIV
    Response, Diagnosis Rates, Linkage Rates, and Eligibility Rates.

### New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)

Based on Incidence Rates and projected New Infections modeled in the
Host Country Context section of this tab, this section of the Data Pack
models how PEPFAR will support identifying these individuals and linking
them to ART. As such, FY23 New Infections Initiated on ART is set as
follows, reflecting both diagnosis and linkage to ART:

*Placeholder for formulas*

Keep in mind that targets for infants to be initiated on ART, as
mentioned above, are set on the EID tab and only reflected here. Also
similar to the above, targets for new infections to be initiated on ART
in \_Military organization units are set and modeled separately by DOD
SI liaisons, and will be pasted here in this column.

### Previous Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)

The above step related to New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)
effectively institutes a floor on the number of individuals who can be
considered eligible for VLT, and a cap on the VLT Coverage Rate,
regardless of the elgibility and coverage rates set previously.

After setting the PopVLS Rate and other assumptions earlier, the Data
Pack calculates both TX_PVLS (N) and TX_PVLS (D) targets. Underlying
these values are assumptions of VLS_NET_NEW as well. Subsequently, the
Data Pack looks to satisfy this VLS_NET_NEW first via those New
Infections to be Initiated on ART and Eligible for VLT. Then, if
VLS_NET_NEW still remains, the Data Pack assumes the remainder must be
filled by initiating on ART those that had been previously infected by
otherwise not on ART.

This column summarizes the result of that remainder calculation, though
in cases where PopVLS Rates lead to exceptionally high VLS_NET_NEW, this
remainder is prevented from ever being negative.

*Placeholder for formulas*

### Total Eligible for VLT (FY23)

The total Eligible for VLT is based first on the total number of
individuals in the incoming treatment pool (TX_CURR from the previous
year's targets), and secondly on the total number of individuals to be
Initiated on TX_CURR who are projected to be on ART within the first
three quarters of the Fiscal Year.

*Placeholder for formulas*

## TX_NEW

**TX_NEW:** Number of adults and children newly enrolled on
anti-retroviral therapy (ART). $Part 1 of 2$

```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_NEW (FY22)** $TX\_NEW.T$

### Instructions

1.  Return to the VLT Coverage section to review assumptions and targets
    related to **New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)**, **Previous
    Infections Initiated on ART (FY23)**, and **Total Initiated on ART
    (FY23)**. Keep in mind that TX_NEW encompasses both those New
    Infections Initiated on ART, as well as those previously infected
    initiated on ART who are treatment naive (as opposed to those who
    returning to treatment).

2.  Review and adjust assumptions for the **Percent of Previous
    Infections Initiated on ART who are Treatment Naive (FY23)**. The
    default for this column is 100% (i.e., none of those previous
    infections to be initiated on treatment in FY23 are returning to
    treatment), though you can adjust this column as appropriate for
    your context.

3.  Review **FY23 TX_NEW** targets and return to previous steps to
    adjust assumptions and modeling decisions as necessary. See below
    for additional information.

4.  Again, it is recommended that you filter out infant populations, as
    these are set separately on the EID tab, and focus on other
    populations at first. Only once you have confirmed targets for \<01
    year olds on the EID tab, return to review those targets on the
    Cascade tab alongside other populations.

### TX_NEW

Because MER guidance stipulates that TX_NEW is to be used for reporting
initiation on ART of those who are treatment naive, TX_NEW may not
always be the same as the target for the Total Initiated on ART (FY23)
set in the VLT Coverage section previously due to portions of the total
number initiated that may be comprised of individuals who are returning
to treatment.

## TX_CURR

**TX_CURR:** Number of adults and children currently receiving
anti-retroviral therapy (ART).

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-TX_CURR-BO-BS-1-1", "latex")

```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-TX_CURR-BO-BS-1-1", "html")

```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_CURR (FY23)** $TX\_CURR.T$

### Instructions

1.  Review and adjust assumptions for **Targeted Retention Rates**, both
    for those Initiated on ART during FY23, and those Already on ART at
    the start of FY23. The default for each of these is 98%, though you
    may adjust these as needed.

2.  Return to the PEPFAR FY22 Targets Cascade section to review the
    **incoming Treatment Cohort**, which often times comprises the bulk
    of TX_CURR targets set in this section.

3.  Return to the VLT Coverage section to review targets for the **Total
    Initiated on ART (FY23)**.

4.  Review targets for **TX_CURR (FY23)**, which is based on the
    incoming Treatment Cohort, the Total Initiated on ART (FY23), and
    related retention rates for each.

5.  Review historic TX_NET_NEW planned during the previous COP, as well
    as targeted TX_NET_NEW resulting from targets modeled in this Data
    Pack for the upcoming Fiscal Year. In some cases, negative
    TX_NET_NEW may result, and may not necessarily indicate quality
    failure, but will be highlighted red to encourage intentional
    discussion about these cases. It may be necessary to return to
    previous sections at this point to adjust assumptions. This review
    and adjustment process may be iterative, and may also depend on
    targets set in the PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs as well.

## TX_CURR_SUBNAT

```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY23)** $TX\_CURR\_SUBNAT.T$

### Instructions

1.  Return and review assumptions for the **PEPFAR Contribution to Host
    Country HIV Response (FY23)** set previously in the
    VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT section of this tab.
2.  Return and review PEPFAR targets for **TX_CURR (FY23)**.
3.  Targets for **TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY23)** are set in this section by
    extrapolating PEPFAR TX_CURR targets to a broader context based on
    PEPFAR's planned contribution to the Host Country HIV Response
    (FY23).
4.  Review the **historic estimated Population ART Coverage** (the total
    on ART, divided by the total PLHIV).
5.  Review the **Planned Population ART Coverage** for the upcoming
    Fiscal Year, based on all the targets set to this point. As needed,
    return to previous sections to adjust assumptions in order to
    influence this column, especially assumptions related to TX_CURR and
    TX_CURR_SUBNAT.

## PEPFAR Testing

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}

```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-Testing-BW-CI-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

There are no Targets from this section that will be imported into DATIM.

### Instructions

1.  As explained above, TX_NEW includes both those who are newly
    infected, as well as those who had been previously living with HIV,
    but who had never been linked to ART. Among this second cohort, one
    portion may have been previously undiagnosed, while another
    previously diagnosed but not on ART. In this section, review and
    adjust assumptions to indicate what percent of those previously
    living with HIV had been **Previously Diagnosed**, as opposed to
    **New Diagnoses**.

2.  Review historic trends from FY22 targets for the **Percent of
    HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX**, and determine how to adjust this
    percentage for FY23 targets.

3.  Review total testing targets (**HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS**) for
    FY23. Where necessary, return to previous assumptions and adjust
    appropriately.

4.  Review FY23 targets for **HTS_INDEX Positive** and adjust the
    Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTX_INDEX for FY23 as necessary.

5.  Review FY23 targets for **PMTCT_STAT New Positives** and **HTS_TST
    Post ANC1 New Positives** and navigate to the PMTCT tab to adjust
    underlying assumptions as necessary.

6.  Review FY23 targets for **TB_STAT New Positives** and navigate to
    the TB tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary.

7.  Review FY23 targets for **VMMC_CIRC Tested Positives** and navigate
    to the VMMC tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary.

8.  Review FY23 targets for **PMTCT_HEI_POS** and navigate to the EID
    tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. For infants under
    1 year old, 100% of testing targets should come through
    PMTCT_HEI_POS. See below for additional information.

9.  Review FY23 targets for **HTS_TST_POS from All Other Modalities**
    and navigate to the HTS tab to adjust underlying assumptions as
    necessary.

10. Review percentage contributions toward FY23 targeted Total Positives
    from HTS_INDEX, PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC,
    PMTCT_HEI_POS, and All Other Modalities. Red highlights across these
    columns indicate cases where targets have been over- or
    under-distributed across modalities. See below for additional
    information about reconciling discrepancies among these modalities.

### Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX

Unlike in past years, the COP22 Data Pack initially sets the percentage
of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX based on the percentage used in the
previous year's targets, but allows adjustments from this beginning rate
as needed.

### Testing Rationalization

As testing targets are set in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, and EID tabs, these
will be reflected here on the Cascade tab to reconcile against those
high-level testing targets set following the logic flow in preceding
sections. This section of the Cascade tab can serve as a Table of
Contents across these tabs as you adjust assumptions and reconcile
targets. Similar Testing Rationalization sections also exist in each of
these tabs for easier reference.

Red highlighting will indicate any case where over- or
under-distribution of testing targets across testing modalities has
occurred. As these issues arise, determine whether to adjust either
TX_NEW or total Testing targets, or related targets in the PMTCT, TB,
VMMC, or EID tabs.

After testing targets have been allocated to PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post
ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, and PMTCT_HEI_POS, any remainder will be
available for further allocation against other testing modalities in the
HTS tab of the Data Pack.

### Testing Targets for Infant Populations

Similar to other targets for \<01 year olds seen on the Cascade Tab,
targets for infants identified as HIV-positive are initially set in the
EID tab, without sex disaggregation. In reflecting these in the Cascade
tab, these values are equally allocated across male and female infants.

Per COP Guidance, 100% of these testing targets for infant populations
should be accommodated for via PMTCT_HEI_POS, and no other modality.
Should any portion of these targets be allocated to any other modality,
an alert will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App. Conditional
formatting within the Data Pack will also indicate when this has
occurred.

## Testing Reference Distribution

schema_table("Cascade-Testing Reference Distribution-CJ-CP-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

No Targets from this section will be imported into DATIM.

### Instructions

1.  Review this section for any cases where targets may be over- or
    under-allocated across modalities, which will be highlighted red for
    easy distinction.
2.  Return to the previous section to review target values as needed, or
    navigate to the PMTCT, TB, EID, or VMMC tabs to adjust targets set
    on these tabs.

## HTS_Index

**HTS_INDEX:** Number of individuals who were identified and tested
using Index testing services and received their results

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_latex_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-HTS_INDEX-CQ-CT-1-1", "latex")

schema_table("Cascade-HTS_INDEX-CU-CX-2-2", "latex")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-HTS_INDEX-CQ-CX-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **COMMUNITY - Contacts Tested, New Positive**
    $HTS\_INDEX\_COM.New.Pos.T$

-   **COMMUNITY - Contacts Tested, New Negative**
    $HTS\_INDEX\_COM.New.Neg.T$

-   **FACILITY - Contacts Tested, New Positive**
    $HTS\_INDEX\_FAC.New.Pos.T$

-   **FACILITY - Contacts Tested, New Negative**
    $HTS\_INDEX\_FAC.New.Neg.T$

### Instructions

1.  Review the estimated percent of total HTS_INDEX positives to be
    identified in **Community Sites**. This will initially be
    pre-populated based on historic trends as recorded in DATIM, but may
    be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over
    100%, or under 0%.

2.  Review estimated **yields** among HTS_INDEX contacts newly tested,
    both for Community and Facility sites. These are initially
    pre-populated based on historic trends from DATIM, but can be
    adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%,
    or under 0%; yellow highlights indicate cases where yield rates are
    less than 20% for 15+ year olds.

3.  Review modeled targets for the following columns. See below for
    additional information:

    a.  COMMUNITY -- Contacts Tested, New Positive

    b.  COMMUNITY -- Contacts Tested, New Negative

    c.  FACILITY-- Contacts Tested, New Positive

    d.  FACILITY-- Contacts Tested, New Negative

4.  Review the Actual percent of HTS_TST_POS to come from Index testing,
    calculated by dividing the sum of Community and Facility
    HTS_INDEX_POS by the total HTS_TST_POS.

### HTS_INDEX Disaggregates

In general, HTS_INDEX disaggregates across both Community and Facility
sites, and across both Negative and Positive HIV test results, are set
by combining HTS_INDEX_POS with the percentages set in steps 1 and 2
above.

Targets for HTS_INDEX New Positives in Community Sites are set as
follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}\  = \ {HTS\_ INDEX.Pos}_{t}\  \times \ {\%\ HTS\_ INDEX\_ POS\ identified\ in\ Community\ Sites}_{t}$ \end{center}
```
Building from this, targets for HTS_INDEX New Negatives in Community
Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Neg}_{t}\  = \ \frac{{HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}}{\text{Community New Tested Yield}_{t}}\  - \ {HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}$ \end{center}
```
Alternatively, targets for HTS_INDEX New Positives in Facility Sites are
set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}\  = \ {HTS\_ INDEX\_ POS}_{t}\  - \ {HTS\_ INDEX\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}$ \end{center}
```
And finally, targets for HTS_INDEX New Negatives in Community Sites are
set as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{center} ${HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Neg}_{t}\  = \ \frac{{HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}}{\text{Facility New Tested Yield}_{t}}\  - \ {HTS\_ INDEX\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}$ \end{center}
```
## DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT

```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=knitr::is_html_output()}
schema_table("Cascade-DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT-CY-CY-1-1", "html")
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **Host Country DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT (FY23)** $DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT.T$

### Instructions

1.  Return to the VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT section to review the **planned
    PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response**.

2.  Review FY23 targets for **Host Country DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT**. This is
    based on the PEPFAR target for Total Testing, but extrapolated to
    the Host Country context following the planned PEPFAR Contribution
    to the HIV Response, then added to the estimated FY22
    DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT indicated in the Host Country Context section of
    the Data Pack.
