# SPECTRUM

The Spectrum tab will allow users to load UNAIDS data with 12 columns of data elements for your OU. A Target Setting Tool-specific .csv file will be produced for your OU. The contents of this file will need to be manually copied and pasted into the Spectrum tab. Because COP timelines are earlier this year, teams can choose to use the finalized July 2023 estimates from last yearâ€™s process, as long as they do not have any major epidemiological updates (e.g., PHIAs, other surveys). While this is not ideal, our understanding is that the UNAIDS Spectrum model has not had major assumption changes, so as long as input data is also stable, there should not be major changes.  We have worked with UNAIDS to ensure that the finalized & published July 2023 estimates can also produce a workable .csv file.

The contents of this file will be manually loaded (ie copied and pasted) into the Spectrum tab which is setup as below:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "Spectrum"
section <- NA
columns <- col_seq("D", "P")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data)) {
  make_table(t, section)
}
```

With GHSD/PEPFAR approval, countries can also populate and input their own data into this tab with a different MOH/country approved set of estimates as an alternate to Spectrum/Naomi results. Estimates changes can also be made in the associated tabs, including Cascade, PMTCT, and VMMC.
