The following pages aim to provide users of the DataPack with the information necessary to successfully complete each tab of the DataPack tool and determine accurate, data-driven targets. For the past several years, the DataPack has a been a key element of PEPFAR COP planning, and for COP22 serves a critical function in assisting PEPFAR Country Teams in setting targets in line with the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals for Testing, Care &amp; Treatment, PMTCT, VMMC, OVC, and other program areas. Please note that the COP22 DataPack is mandatory and must be used to set targets for COP22. For COP22, all indicators included in the DataPack are MER 2.6 indicators. For further information on the MER 2.6 indicators, please go to https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200929315-MER. 1.1 About the DataPack The COP22 DataPack supports analysis for all targets by Priority Subnational Unit (PSNU), population, and Implementing Mechanism (IM). This tool supports calculation of targets based on expected treatment coverage rates by type of PSNU and population prioritization: Attained Scale-up: Aggressive Scale-up: Saturation Sustained Prioritizations for PSNUs are based on COP Guidance section 7.3.2.ba. These determine for a given PSNU programmatically what HIV treatment and prevention services should be planned and informs both the overall strategy and the targets. Teams must review and revise their PSNU prioritization levels for COP22. The COP22 DataPack assumes a test and start treatment platform and will develop targets for achieving 95% coverage in Scale up: Aggressive and Scale-up: Saturation PSNUs; all other targets in the DataPack are based on the treatment targets, insofar as the treatment targets are the main focus of reaching epidemic control, and therefore relate to both testing and prevention targets. The DataPack will allow PEPFAR teams to use country specific programmatic assumptions to develop the optimal targets by PSNU along the program cascades to ensure the necessary number of PLHIV are diagnosed, linked, and start treatment. The DataPack does not necessarily calculate targets for every indicator, but it has space for teams to enter targets for all indicators and thus can be used to record agreed-upon COP targets, even for non-calculated indicators. Teams must not modify the structure of the COP22 DataPack in any way. The Office of the US Global Aids Coordinator (OGAC) has developed a process by which targets can be directly imported into DATIM via the DataPack Site Tool in order to generate targets. However, this is only possible for teams that do not in any way alter the structure or format of the DataPack. Additional details are provided in COP Guidance and will be available through COP webinars. 1.2 Highlighted Changes from COP21 to COP22 The COP22 DataPack is largely the same as the COP21 DataPack. However, please note the following updates that have been implemented as a result of multiple feedback sessions with various country teams that had been identified by the PRIME team, as well as new programmatic changes that are reflected in the Section 7 of COP guidance. These changes revolve around workflow, ease of target setting, and linkage to the COP guidance based on different aspects of the DataPack that worked well and others that did not during COP21 target stetting: New Cascade Approach that will flow from Program Viral Load Suppression to testing to allow for countries closer or at Epi Control to more easily set targets, based on Section 7 of COP22 Guidance. Integration of new SNS Modalities for HTS and HTS_Recent. Targets will no longer be set for PrEP_CURR, but instead will be set for a replacement indicator of PrEP_CT. 50+ finer age bands across the clinical cascade. These will be aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR. PSNUxIM tab structure that will again handle de-duplication and IM allocation. 1.3 Data Flow and Review Process to COP22 Submission The results from APR20 have been taken from DATIM and used to populate the DataPack. In turn, the DataPack targets will produce FY22 targets that will be subsequently submitted through DATIM after COP22 has been finalized and the PSNU level data entered into the Strategic Direction Summary (SDS) tables, where appropriate (Target related data).

Country Team uses DataPack Self-Service App to sync data with PAW Dossiers. Country Team saves DataPack to SharePoint under the OUs HQ Collaboration &gt; COP 2022 - FY 2023 &gt; Guidance, Tools, and Resources folder. Country Team submits a ticket in ZenDesk that includes: A link to the DataPack file saved in SharePoint Confirmation that this file has been pre-validated in the DataPack Self-Service App Confirmation that this file has been sent to PAW via the DataPack Self-Service App In copy: Chair, PPM, assigned DUIT Liaison, and any Interagency members that should be aware of ongoing review and discussions. Once this ticket is received, the DataPack Support Team will confirm all the above has occurred and send additional instructions as needed The PPM reviews the ticket/email thread and confirms the correct individuals have all been copied. The assigned PPM and the assigned DUIT Liaison use both the DataPack Self-Service App and the PAW COP Dossiers to validate and review the DataPack, noting any feedback in the ticket/email thread. The assigned Chair should also review all feedback on the ticket thread and any additional comments as needed. As is possible, all the above should occur within a 24 hour turnaround from the initial submission of a DataPack from a Country Team. While this process will remain the same for each submission for review, the content of each review will differ, as explained below. Once a Zendesk ticket and email thread has been started with an initial DataPack submission, all future DataPack submissions related to the same Country should use the same thread/ticket to allow for easy coordination. Submission 1 Validate high-level strategic planning direction aligns with the vision set by the PLL. Highlight any areas for technical assistance. Ensure construction of DataPack has not been tampered with. For this stage of review, it is not expected that your PSNUxIM tab be completed or even populated. At this stage, the focus should be on ensuring the high-level cascade is strategically aligned, and only afterward proceeding to allocating targets to IMs. Note that this is also partly to avoid Excel performance issues that may occur with the addition of more data to the PSNUxIM tab. Submission 2 Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during your first submission. Confirm no discrepancies between targets modeled in your submitted DataPack and any COP Meeting presentations to date or other high-level discussions had with PPMs and Chairs. Review the PSNUxIM tab and address issues related to IM and DSD-TA allocation, and deduplication. Submission 3 Again confirm DataPack alignment with all high-level decisions and any final presentations given by the Country Team. Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during the second submission. Track down and resolve any last bugs and issues in seen in the DataPack Confirm the DataPack is as near final as possible Final Submission Confirm all targets modeled in the DataPack are ready for submission to DATIM. Secure Interagency Government sign-off for import of your submitted DataPack to DATIM. Note authority to waive any lingering validation issues flagged by the DataPack Self-Service App. Once approval by PPMs, Chairs, and Liaisons is documented on the Zendesk thread/ticket, the DataPack Support Team will move forward with uploading your submitted DataPack to DATIM, then note completion of this here on this ticket. Once this is done, it is recommended that you review your data in DATIM to ensure alignment between DATIM and your DataPack. Please note in addition to these regular formal submissions, we encourage regular sharing and dialogue with Chair, PPM, and DUIT Liaison around target setting process generally, and DataPack specifically. Feel free to share draft versions as often as is helpful. 1.4 DataPack SharePoint Location The DataPack will be posted on PEPFAR SharePoint: www.pepfar.net. The file path will be OU &gt; Country Name &gt; HQ Collaboration &gt; COP 2022  FY2023 &gt; Guidance, Tools, and Resources. The file name will be Datapack_CountryName_20220121... Please reference the day in which the file was added to the folder. If there are new .zip files added, please utilize this file as it may be a new version of the DataPack tool. 1.5 Tab Categories Each DataPack will start with 21 tabs organized in the order presented below. Upon downloading the DataPack, the PSNUxIM tab will appear as a blank sheet, but will be generated by the self-service validation app after you submit your preliminary DataPack.

Each section of the guide will list what columns users can expect to have data prepopulated and / or where they can enter data themselves. ENTERING DATA IN THE WRONG SECTION If you enter data into a cell that you are not supposed to enter data into, you will receive the following message box with corrective action suggestions as well. Example: 1.9 Adjustments to Historic Targets and Results Throughout the DataPack, historic targets and results have been provided for reference and often to drive target modeling algorithms. If, in the process of reviewing these historic data, issues with the data are discovered that may need to be addressed in DATIM, follow the below procedure: Raise specific issues with historic data to your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Determine together whether any issue identified requires updating values in DATIM. It maybe that together with your PPM and DUIT Liaison you decide that changes to historic values are not necessary in DATIM, but still necessary in the DataPack. This is an extraordinary circumstance and must have approval from PRIME/DUIT leadership via your Liaison to allow. If approved, you may make changes directly in the related column of the DataPack. If it is the case that DATIM values should be updated, follow the usual process for OPU Target changes, requesting all necessary approvals to initiate and expedite this process during COP. Once changes are aprroved, either through an OPU for targets, or through data change request for results, you can enter the new values into the related column of the DataPack yourself. If you wish to request a new DataPack, you may do so, but will have to start the DataPack process afresh. For either of these routes, reach out to the DataPack Systems Team via Zendesk for support.

Improves documentation of packDataPackSheet, packSheets, and prepareSheetData. 2.5.4 Deprecated features loginToDATIM is retired in favor of the same function in datimutils. All instances of this function being invoked have been replaced appropriately. The functions DHISLogin, GetCredentialsFromConsole, LoadConfigFile, and ValidateConfig were not exported and are now deprecated as well. They were previously only used by loginToDATIM. isLoggedIn is retired as it was only used in getMechList and loginToDATIM. 2.6 datapackr 5.0.2 2.6.1 Bug fixes Resolves a bug with packOPUDataPack where createDataPack was not implemented correctly in version 5.0.1. Patches a bug with getOPUDataFromDATIM where getCOPDataFromDATIM returns a dataframe where the default Category Option Combo UID is listed as default rather than the appropriate DATIM UID. This will be removed in favor of a more permanent solution in future updates. 2.6.2 New features Significantly improves handling of parameter checks and standardizes their validation and defaults. Documentation for these checks is also added. Adds functionality for producing COP22 Beta Packs and test data. 2.6.3 Breaking changes Removes getDataPackSchema in favor of consolidated pick_schema. 2.6.4 Deprecated features getDataPackSchema has been deprecated in favor of pick_schema and has been replaced in the two locations where it was previously used. 2.6.5 Minor improvements and fixes Improves and updates tests related to parameter checks and schemas.

The d2_session argument has been removed from the following functions: check_params createDataPack (previously createWorkbook) unPackSchema_datapack 2.7.3 Minor improvements and fixes unPackSchema_datapack was modified in the following ways: Now uses the datapack_cogs data set rather than making a query to DATIM. Inherits parameters from datapackr_params. writeHomeTab was modified in the following ways: The wb and datapack_name arguments default to NULL. Checks and assigns parameters using the check_params function. Lists country names on the Home tab in addition to Country UIDs. Minor corrections were made to Excel functions written by packSNUxIM that had been erroneously changed during previous linting. Internal changes were made to variable names and functions used inside the check_params function. A new file has been added to data-raw to generate the datapack_cogs data set. Documentation is now provided for the cop20OPU_data_pack_schema data set. "],["03-Whats-New.html", "3 Whats New? 3.1 Section 7 Changes 3.2 MER2.6 Changes 3.3 PSNUxIM Tool Formulas", " 3 Whats New? 3.1 Section 7 Changes Reorienting of the Cascade Tab around PVLS, rather than ART Coverage, although both are taken into account. This years new shift to begin setting the Cascade from Program Viral Load Suppression. This starting point will allow for country team users to build up a full cascade that will provide insight into VLS, VL Testing and how this will translate into determining the new on treatment and those returning to treatment. It will provide a full picture of the treatment ecosystem and the way in which countries understand if they will achieve 86% (95% x 95% x 95%) coverage across all three Cascades. This will allow countries that are at or close to Epidemic Control to better approach the understanding of how they will continue to sustain their 95-95-95 goals. This approach will put a greater emphasis on the Coverage Cascade as the driver of the target setting process, a direct shift from the past 5 years that have focused on the first two Cascades, and paint a picture of both VL to gap in Treatment and Testing. 3.2 MER2.6 Changes Changes in line with MER 2.6: Use of PrEP_CT in lieu of PrEP_CURR. Integration of the new SNS modality. 50+ finer age bands across the clinical cascade. These will be aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR. The introduction of 65+ age bands for TX_CURR targets this year will be visible across the Cascade, PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs. For structural purposes of these tabs to seamlessly work with the new inclusion of the 50+ finer age bands, targets will be set across many indicators at the finer age bands across the clinical cascade. The most important thing for users to note is that these will be aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR. The breakdown that has been used to disaggregate the 50+ age band into the finer age bands up to 65+ is the following: 50-54: 42% 55-59: 35% 60-64 14% 65+: 9% These percentages were determined through various research studies. If teams feel as though they need to adjust the breakdowns based on local data and research they are able to do so, but should first consult their Chair, PPM and DUIT Liaison. 3.3 PSNUxIM Tool Formulas When you received your newly generated PSNUxIM tool for the first time by generating it from the DataPack Self-Service App, you will need to scroll to the Target Values Section that begins in column CW and copy down the formulas populated in row 15 all the way down to the bottom of your DataPack. This will be required in order for your Roll-up column to properly populate as well as the Deduplication sections. "],["04-Frequently-Asked-Questions.html", "4 Frequently Asked Questions", " 4 Frequently Asked Questions Q: Cascade Tab Host Country Context section column V H.C. Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS and column X H.C. Est. Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22) are blank, how should I fill these out or can I leave them blank? A: These two columns have been added and left blank for country teams to add in data, should they have reliable Host Country Data available to them. Should a team have access to this data, they should consult their PPM and DUIT Liaison prior to populating the columns. If a country does not have good Host Country Data VL data, the best way forward is likely to leave blank, and the DataPack will work with your PEPFAR TX_PVLS data on its own. Q: I have an outstanding COP21 OPU for IM shifts, what should I do? A: For OUs with outstanding target-shift OPUs that are only shifting targets from one IM to another. This OPU will not affect the DataPack that has been issued thus far since it does not have a generated PSNUxIM tab (note this tab should not be generated until all main tabs have been filled-in). However, if the team would like the OPU to be taken into account in the COP22 DataPacks PSNUxIM tab, the OU SI teams should NOT generate a PSNUxIM tab for the COP22 DataPack until their target shift OPU memos are fully approved, and the target shifts are imported into DATIM. Otherwise, they should be prepared to also make the allocation updates in their COP22 PSNUxIM tab that will align with the OPU update. Q: Why are there more than just TX_CURR (FY23) Indicators being set at the new finer 65+ age bands despite MER2.6 Guidance? A: Due to the structure of the Cascade tab, and other COP22 - FY23 Targets that rely on TX_CURR (FY23), the tool had to be built, such that these tabs are all disaggregated to the the 65+ age band. However, upon completion of the DataPack, ONLY TX_CURR (FY23) will be import to DATIM with the finer age bands. All other indicators will be aggregated to 50+. Q: When working through PSNUxIM KP mechanism allocations and I allocate the KP-specific targets to KP partners, given that the KP disaggregates are a subset of the total population being targeted, do I also need to allocate total pop targets to the KP partner? A: Yes, you should be setting a corresponding Total Pop target against each mechanism you set KeyPop targets against. This is because KeyPop is a subset of Total Pop. Note however, that only clinical, facility partners may have targets and report many indicators. For these indicators, the KP targets must be assigned to a partner and site qualified to report the results. Q: Can you use FY23 Spectrum estimates to work through the Cascade tab? A: No, unless you receive approval from OGAC Leadership you should use FY22 Spectrum Data. Your target setting process for the COP22 DataPack should be to set FY23 targets based on where you are ending FY22. Q: Is the coverage rate that is used to calculate Targeted Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22) and Targeted Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) too high or being miscalculated? A: No, this is not a formula error. The calculations occurring are focusing on PLHIV for each district that are being treated for HIV/AIDS for each age band, as opposed to those being treated for HIV/AIDS in the district regardless of whether they live in that district. if the PEPFAR results are higher than the PLHIV Spectrum estimate in a particular district, then back-calculating the coverage rate shows a greater than 100% value for that PSNU-Age-Sex band. This can come from one of two things generally: People are coming from outside the district to seek treatment, leading to a higher PEPFAR TX_CURR value than PLHIV in the district; or The PLHIV estimate from Spectrum is too low. Either way if you have good programmatic reason for doing so, particularly health seeking behavior of PLHIV, you can aim for a coverage rate even higher than 100% (e.g., current coverage in capital city is estimated at 105%, but due to health seeking behavior you want to aim for 120% to achieve 95% for across all metropolitan area). Q: Why in the newly generated PSNUxIM tab are data-pack totals and roll up columns blank? A: Once you have regenerated your PSNUxIM tab from the DataPack Self-Service app, please open your newly regenerated tool, save your tool and close it. When you reopen your tool, it should populate your targets into that column. You will also need to drag down the formula in the far right Target Values section of the PSNUxIM tab to ensure all rows are populated with the proper formula. Q: If my program performs testing but not treatment, how do I represent this in the DataPack? A: You will first need approval from OGAC Leadership to do this. If you receive this approval you will need to manually alter in the Cascade Tab column HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS (FY22) (BD). Please make the alterations to this column and not on the HTS tab. Q: When I try to validate my DataPack in the self-service app, I get a message saying ERROR: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification. How do I resolve this? A: This error can be caused by a number of different issues. The most common causes and their resolutions include: Trying to validate a newly regenerated DataPack before opening it and saving it. After generating or regenerating your PSNUxIM tab, it is necessary to first open your tool and save it before uploading it to the app. The browser is causing issues with the app. This can be resolved by opening an Incognito window or by clearing your cache. PLEASE NOTE: Clearing your cache will sign you out of all accounts in that browser. Trying to validate a file that isnt an XLSX. If your team has saved your DataPack in a different file format for sharing, such as XLSB, ensure that you resave the file as an XLSX before validating it in the app. The target distribution formulas on the PSNUxIM tab have not been applied to all rows. By default, the formulas in the Target Value section (Column CW and right) are only applied to Row 15. Once you generate or regenerate your PSNUxIM tab, ensure that you copy these formulas all the way down to the bottom row of your targets. After this is done, try validating your tool again. If none of the above issues apply to your DataPack tool and you are still receiving this error, please submit a ZenDesk ticket identifying your country and attaching or linking to a copy of the DataPack tool that caused the error in the app. "],["05-Cheat_Sheet.html", "5 Testing Targets Cheat Sheet 5.1 Purpose 5.2 Issue 5.3 Is this issue in my DataPack? 5.4 Why is this issue in my DataPack? 5.5 Possible solutions 5.6 How to try these solutions in the DataPack", " 5 Testing Targets Cheat Sheet 5.1 Purpose The purpose of this cheat sheet is to document a recurring DataPack issue to guide other OUs towards a solution. This document does not supersede PEPFAR guidance. For more questions, please contact the ICPI Zendesk. 5.2 Issue Our HTS_TST_POS targets from modalities are summing to over 100% of the HTS_TST_POS total. We have too many positives but cannot figure out how to resolve the errors in the datapack? 5.3 Is this issue in my DataPack? This issue is most likely to affect countries with high treatment coverage but has been seen in lower coverage OUs as well If your DataPack has negative values in the Other Modalities (Cascade Tab; Column BR) or a large HTS POS difference to adjust (HTS Tab; Column BO) AND You have already walked through the instructions in the Datapack User Guide HTS Section link HERE 5.4 Why is this issue in my DataPack? COP guidance in COP21 recommended that age/sex/SNU combinations with high treatment coverage (above 80%) have a high rate of positives (75%) coming from index testing and the COP21 target was used to pre-populated the COP22 datapack, but countries may already have more than 25% of positives coming from other passive modalities (PMTCT, TB). Thus while you are trying to continue an effective testing strategy based on past COP guidance and/or trying to set appropriately ambitious targets from active testing modalities (e.g., Index, SNS) based on COP22 guidance, the DataPack defaults also have a high percent of positives coming from more passive modalities that may be based on a standard of care for that entry point (PMTCT, TB), but are not necessarily strategic case finding strategies. This guidance can help you evaluate if there are strategic ways to re-examine the assumptions around these standard of care, passive modalities that help you optimize your testing strategy. 5.5 Possible solutions Work with your PMTCT and TB program colleagues to review your program and surveillance data and increase the percentage of known positives coming from PMTCT (and other modalities, such as TB and VMMC). Also review positivity of VMMC, and make sure it hasnt been thrown off by historical high percentage, potentially from low volume (e.g., 1 of 5 were positive, inflating to 20%) Changes in PMTCT are most likely to decrease high positives (while maintaining ambitious targets for your PMTCT program) See examples below for PMTCT and TB indicators If still unable to resolve high positives, adjust the % of positives that come from Index Testing according to COP22 Guidance. 5.6 How to try these solutions in the DataPack Remember that you can only change the sea green columns in the DP. The following solutions are in order of impact (high to low). 5.6.1 PMTCT Tab - decrease positives from ANC and Post-ANC1 Goal: To reduce column AE Newly Tested, Positive which feeds into the total HTS_TST_POS values that are too high Shift positives from newly tested to known positives Column Z Est. % ANC1 clients already Known HIV Positive (%) Increasing column Z directly increases column AD Known HIV Status, Positive by the same amount it decreases column AF Newly Tested, Negative ultimate reducing Newly Tested Positives This reduction in New Positives may be small Column AB Est. Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients (%) Decreasing column AB directly decreases column AE Newly Tested, Positive by the same amount it decreases column AF Newly Tested, Negative This reduction in Newly Tested Positives will be bigger, proceed with caution Goal: To reduce Column AU Positives from Post ANC1 This change will most likely only have a small impact on your total positives Increasing Known Positives (in step above) reduces Column AQ Total eligible for Post ANC1 retesting thereby reducing column AU Positive Column AS Yield (%) Reducing Yield will reduce Positive (AU) While it is not plausible to see no positives from Post ANC1, consider a programmatic maximum that you would like to target While it is possible to change Column AQ, we recommend not altering this column directly so as to not create logical gaps in PMTCT testing process 5.6.2 TB tab - decrease positives from TB Goal: To reduce column Q Newly Tested, Positive which feeds into the total HTS_TST_POS values that are too high Shift positives from newly tested to known positives Column L Est. % TB clients already Known HIV Positive (%) Increasing column L directly increases column P Known HIV Status, Positive by the same amount it decreases column R Newly Tested, Negative ultimate reducing Newly Tested Positives This reduction in New Positives may be small Column N Est.

What type of data? Indicates whether the data in the column is an integer, e.g., a whole number, or a percentage. Prepopulated data? Indicates whether the data in this column is prepopulated from data in DATIM or from data elsewhere in the DataPack. Enter or modify data? Indicates whether the user should enter new information into this column or is allowed to modify the prepopulated information in the column. If there is a question mark here, country teams must consult with their PPMs and Chairs before modifying the data in this column. If there is an exclamation mark here, country teams may overwrite the formula in this column, however it will prevent the DataPack from refreshing this data if changes are made elsewhere. Calculated column? This indicates that a formula is used to indicate where a formula is used to calculate the values in this column from data elsewhere in the DataPack. Linked column? This indicates that this data is either prepopulated by or is used to prepopulate data in a column on another tab within the DataPack. For columns that are prepopulated from another tab, clicking on the hyperlinked column name in the DataPack will take you to the referenced column. UID in Appendix.

Of all tabs in the COP22 DataPack, this tab experienced the most changes compared to the COP21 DataPack, reflecting changes in PEPFAR COP guidance to reemphasize the importance of Viral Load Testing Coverage (VLC) and Viral Load Suppression (VLS) in the HIV response. As seen in Section 7 of PEPFAR COP/ROP 2022 Guidance, Country Teams are asked to center their COP22 discussions around the concept of Population Viral Load Suppression (PopVLS), or the percent of all People Living with HIV who have a suppressed viral load. This metric provides a succinct, composite view of the HIV response, including: new infections, testing &amp; diagnosis, linkage to and retention on treatment, eligibility for viral load testing, roll out of viral load testing, and viral load suppression. Because this is a fundamental shift in the Cascade tab from previous years, it is important to have an overall understanding of the flow of the Cascade calculations from FY23 estimated PLHIV to the TX_PVLS and TX_NEW targets. This logical flow is described in the figure below. The key assumption is the Planned PopVLS rate (FY23), which takes you from the FY23 estimated PLHIV to the measured number of virally suppressed patients in the OU (VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23)). This use of the term % PopVLS should be distinguished from its use in other settings where it is meant to convey the theoretical fraction of PLHIV who are virally suppressed (whether in-care or out of care, tested for viral load or not). As used in the DataPack, PopVLS is a programmatic PopVLS that conveys only what can be measured either by the host country or by PEPFAR. The VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) is then multiplied by the Planned PEPFAR Contribution to the HIV Response (FY23) to give the PEPFAR TX_PVLS (N) (FY23) target. The PEPFAR TX_PVLS_D is then divided by the Planned VLS Rate (FY23) to yield the TX_PVLS (D) (FY23) target. The DataPack then calculates the TX_NEW target from the TX_PVLS (D) target. Because TX_PVLS (D) is only the number of persons on treatment tested for VL, the DataPack calculates the total number eligible for VL testing by dividing by the Planned VLT Coverage (FY23). The number eligible for viral load testing can be thought of as the sum of those who were already on treatment, i.e. TX_CURR (FY22), and those who are initiated on treatment during FY23 and eligible for VLT. To get the number of persons initiated on treatment (whether eligible for VLT or not), we divide by the Planned % Recently Initiated on ART Eligible for VLT (FY23). The number initiated on treatment during FY23 is similar to TX_NEW, but still may contain individuals who may have previously been on ART, fallen out of care, and re-initiated treatment who may not need to be retested for HIV and who should not be included in TX_NEW. Therefore, we calculate the # of previous infections who are treatment naïve by multiplying the total number of previous infections by the % Prev. Infections Initiated on ART who are Treatment Naïve. TX_NEW is then calculated as the sum of previous infections who are treatment naïve and the new infections initiated on ART. As in past DataPacks, this tab interweaves with many other tabs of the DataPack, including the PMTCT, TB, EID, VMMC, KP, HTS, CXCA, HTS_RECENT, and TX_TB_PREV tabs. As is explained below and in sections related to these tabs, DataPack logic is most useful when target-setting begins in the Cascade tab and progresses from left to right, both within that tab, and across and within all other tabs, returning iteratively to the Cascade tab throughout. 10.1 Host Country Context .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1;

For those leveraging alternatives to Spectrum, see below. In specific, the Host Country Context section of the Cascade tab provides space for reflecting the following data: Host Country Estimated Population (FY22) \\(POP\\_EST.T\\_1\\): Estimated population, projected as of September 2022. Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY22) \\(PLHIV.T\\_1\\): Estimated number of people living with HIV, projected as of September 2022. Host Country Estimated HIV Prevalence (FY22) (%) \\(HIV\\_PREV.T\\_1\\): Estimated HIV Prevalence, projected as of September 2022. Host Country Projected Incidence Rate (FY22) (%) \\(Incidence\\_SUBNAT.Rt.T\\_1\\): Estimated incidence rate, projected as of September 2022. Host Country Projected New Infections (FY23) \\(NEW\\_INFECTIONS\\_SUBNAT.T\\_1\\): Estimated new infections projected to occur in FY23, based on projected FY22 Incidence Rates.

ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY22) \\(VL\\_TESTING\\_SUBNAT.T\\_1\\): Estimated number of ART Patients who have been tested for Viral Load Suppression, projected as of September 2022. *See note below Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22) \\(VL\\_SUPPRESSED.T\\_1\\): Estimated PLHIV who are on ART and have a suppressed viral load, projected as of September 2022. *See note below *Note: This indicator is not available via Spectrum for COP22. If high quality data is available from another source, you may enter it this here, overwriting formulas, though retain data source documentation. However, if data is not readily available, it is best to leave this column blank  the DataPack was designed to populate subsequent columns even without this data. 10.1.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section, replacing any preexisting estimates for these indicators that may have already been entered in DATIM: Host Country Estimated Population (FY22) \\(POP\\_EST.T\\_1\\) Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY22) \\(PLHIV.T\\_1\\) Host Country Estimated HIV Prevalence (FY22) (%) \\(HIV\\_PREV.T\\_1\\) Host Country PLHIV Diagnosed (FY22) \\(DIAGNOSED\\_SUBNAT.T\\_1\\) Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY21) \\(TX\\_CURR\\_SUBNAT.R\\) Host Country Estimated TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22) \\(TX\\_CURR_SUBNAT.T\\_1\\) Host Country Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY22) \\(VL\\_TESTING\\_SUBNAT.T\\_1\\) Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22) \\(VL\\_SUPPRESSED.T\\_1\\) 10.1.2 Instructions If using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data: Review the above columns to confirm that data has been correctly linked with the Spectrum tab. You may consider using filter drop-down menus to quickly inspect for any non-numeric, negative, or invalid data. Review Relative Standard Error values to identify any estimates with a Relative Standard Error of more than or equal to 20. See the section below for additional instructions. If leveraging alternatives to UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data, see the below section. Confirm that no data has been entered against _Military Organization Units. See below for more explanation. Please note that the Host Country Estimated Patients Tested for VLS (FY22) and the Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22) are not available from Spectrum/Naomi. Therefore, they will not populate from the Spectrum tab. The DataPack does not need it populated to work, and if it is left blank the DataPack will rely on PEPFAR MER data. 10.1.3 Leveraging Alternatives to Spectrum Most countries are encouraged to use UNAIDS Spectrum as their source for the above data. However, Country Teams may request approval from their PPM and a DUIT Liaison to use an alternative data source if deemed more reliable. In this case, paste estimates from other approved sources into this section of the Cascade tab by overwriting the formulas currently in these green columns. Due to hidden Relative Standard Error columns between the various estimate columns, it is recommended you paste this data in one column at a time, rather than in bulk. It may also reduce technical issues to first copy geographic data in the SNU1, PSNU, Age, and Sex columns into a separate spreadsheet, then use Excel lookup functions to add estimates data against the correct geographies and populations, and then return to pasting data into the original Cascade tab column by column. Please note that it is not required to populate the Host Country Estimated Patients Tested for VLS (FY22) and the Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22) columns. In fact, in the absence of appropriate programmatic or clinical data, it is inadvisable to expend great effort on making these estimates. The DataPack has been redesigned with the understanding that most countries will not have these data. If these columns are left blank, the DataPack will automatically use PEPFAR program data to estimate the Working PopVLS Rate and the cascade calculations will still be able to proceed. 10.1.4 Relative Standard Errors UNAIDS Spectrum estimates are accompanied by Relative Standard Errors (RSE) for each data point, both at the District level as well as the Age/Sex-specific level. These indicate the relative reliability of each of these data, which should be considered when using these to make program planning decisions. Along with the data points above, RSEs will also automatically be populated in the Cascade tab from data loaded into the Spectrum tab. While initially these RSE columns will be hidden, you can unhide these columns to inspect these values. RSEs are also used to color-coded related columns based on the relative uncertainty of each specific data point as follows: Red: RSE \\(\\geq\\) 40. Yellow: RSE &lt; 40, but \\(\\geq\\) 20. Green: RSE &lt; 20. Red or yellow highlighting may not always mean a data point should be disregarded, nor is it the case that all green values should be taken at face value. Either way, consider these RSEs as helpful guideposts in interpreting the contextual meaning and quality of UNAIDS Spectrum estimates. If, in reviewing Relative Standard Error values, the uncertainty interval of an estimate appears to be concerning, consider the following next steps: Raise and discuss the issue with your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Communicate concerns to assigned UNAIDS liaisons and discuss appropriate methods for improving or better understanding data quality for the data points in question. 10.1.5 Host Country Estimates for Military Organization Units Due to issues of political sensitivity and national security, estimates for the above indicators should not be entered against Military Organization Units. Any case where this does occur will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App, and removed during DATIM import. 10.2 PEPFAR FY21 Cascade (Observed) &amp; PEPFAR FY22 Cascade (Planned) .tabwid

This analysis for popVLS, helps the DataPack user simulate the percentage of PLHIV who are virally suppressed, either from Host Country or PEPFAR data, which derives downstream PEPFAR cascade indicators beginning with TX_PVLS. 10.3.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) \\(VL\\_SUPPRESSED.T\\) 10.3.2 Instructions Review historic PEPFAR and Host Country data to understand existing trends by geography and population. Review the estimated PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response for FY22, and adjust the planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response for FY23. See below. Review baseline Working PopVLS Rate for FY22. This is estimated from Host Country PLHIV estimates and either Host Country VLS data, if available, or extrapolated from PEPFAR VLS data otherwise. Review and adjust the Planned PopVLS Rate for FY23. See below for additional information Review resulting VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT. See below for additional information. 10.3.3 PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response While PEPFARs contribution to the HIV response within the Host Country may vary across areas of that response, this column attempts to summarize this contribution for use in modeling subsequent targets. The DataPack first attempts to describe PEPFARs contribution during FY22, based on both Host Country estimates as well as PEPFAR Results and Targets. Keep in mind as you review these data that the methodologies used in producing Host Country estimates may produce artificial discrepancies between PEPFAR and Host Country values. For example, if Host Country estimates are produced from household surveys, these residential-centric data may differ significantly from PEPFARs data, which are largely collected at point of service. (Because of this, it is recommended that Host Country estimates follow a point-of-service model where possible.) In the following column, adjust values to reflect PEPFARs planned contribution to the HIV response. Keep in mind that if PEPFARs FY21 results or FY22 targets are greater than Host Country Estimates for a given geography of population, it may be wise to maintain this same relationship to avoid depressing treatment and testing values set later in the Cascade tab beyond what would be the result of projected retention rates. 10.3.4 Working &amp; Planned PopVLS Rates One of the most pivotal assumptions in the DataPack is the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23). In planning your PopVLS rate, you should consider your OUs current status in this age-sex-PSNU stratum as represented in the Working PopVLS Rate (FY22) column and your OUs ambitious but feasible aspiration for expansion of VLC. It is important to understand that the DataPack does not require you to estimate the Host Country FY22 PopVLS. Host Country columns may be left blank and the DataPack will estimate Working PopVLS from the imported MER data. To calculate the estimated  or, Working  PopVLS Rate for FY22 (i.e., projected as of September 2022), the Data Pack may use a variety data points, depending on data availability for a given geography and population. In all cases, the denominator of this calculation is the estimated PLHIV, making it critical that this data be added to the Data Pack in the Host Country Context section. For its numerator, the DataPack first attempts to use Host Country estimates of the total number of Virally Suppressed ART Patients (\\(VL\\_SUPPRESSED.T\\_1\\)): \\[ \\frac{Host\\ Country\\ Est.\\ Virally\\ Suppressed\\ ART\\ Patients\\ (FY22)}{Host\\ Country\\ Est.\\ PLHIV\\ (FY22)} \\] However, when Host Country estimates of the number of virally suppressed ART patients are unavailable, the DataPack refers instead to PEPFAR data for TX_PVLS (N) either from FY22 targets or, if these are also unavailable, FY21 results, and then extrapolates these to the Host Country context by referencing the Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response set previously. \\[ \\frac{PEPFAR\\ TX\\_ PVLS}{Host\\ Country\\ Est.\\ PLHIV\\ (FY22)} \\] Reviewing and understanding the Working PopVLS Rate arrived at in this column is critical for much of the rest of the DataPack. In particular, this column is immediately used to inform the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23) in the next column. While the default in this column is 95% x 95% x 95%, reflecting the UNAIDS 95 for All goals, anytime the Working PopVLS Rate from FY22 is higher than this default for a given geography/population, the higher number will be used instead. The gap between the FY23 Planned and FY22 Working PopVLS Rates is instrumental in determining the following key data points throughout the remainder of the Cascade Tab: Host Country VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT PEPFAR TX_PVLS (N) PEPFAR TX_PVLS (D) PEPFAR TX_NEW PEPFAR TX_CURR PEPFAR TX_CURR_SUBNAT PEPFAR HTS_TST totals No matter the starting default for Planned PopVLS rate, you may adjust this target to fit the realities of your country context and your treatment program. It may also be helpful to return to this column to iteratively adjust it as you proceed through the next few sections of the DataPack. To help conceptualize how you might adjust the planned PopVLS Rate, please review the figure in the introduction of this section which describes the role of the Planned PopVLS Rate assumption in the overall logic of calculating the TX_PVLS and TX_NEW targets. As described in the introduction, Planned PopVLS is not intended to convey the idea of population viral load suppression as used in some other settings to mean the theoretical fraction of the PLHIV population that is virally suppressed (whether in care or out of care, tested or untested). Rather, it is best thought of as a programmatic PopVLS value that summarizes the relationship between PLHIV and the clinically known and measured number of virally suppressed PLHIV on treatment as described in the figure above. The single Planned PopVLS number should take into account the % diagnosed, % linked to ART, % contributed to by PEPFAR, % eligible for viral load testing, % tested for viral load, and % virally suppressed. The calculations in this figure may also be written out as the following formula: INSERT FORMULA FROM UG Revisions #1 Of the factors included in the Planned PopVLS formula, Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Responses (FY23), Planned VLT Coverage (FY23) and Planned VLS Rate (FY23) are present as such in the DataPack. However, percent diagnosed in the full population may be different from the DataPack assumption column Planned % New Infections Diagnosed (FY23), which is applied to new (FY23) infections only. Percent linked among all diagnosed may similarly be different from the DataPack assumption column Targeted Linkage Rate (FY23), which in the DataPack is only applied to persons diagnosed in FY23. Finally, the proportion of the full FY22 TX_CURR eligible for VLT relates to the entire FY23 treatment cohort, whereas the DataPack assumption of Planned % Recently Initiated on ART Eligible for VLT (FY23) with default of 70% only applies to those initiated on ART in FY23; the proportion eligible in the full treatment cohort will be substantially higher and can be calculated by assuming that 100% of the FY22 treatment cohort are eligible for viral load and taking a weighted average of the percentages as follows: INSERT FORMULA FROM UG Revisions #2 Because the DataPack calculates viral load testing, treatment, and testing targets by first setting the measured number of virally suppressed persons (VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT [FY23]) using the Planned PopVLS Rate and then stepping back up the cascade, if the Planned PopVLS Rate and these other assumptions are not internally consistent, then the DataPack may give unexpected results, such as setting targets above the PLHIV estimate. Having an understanding of the relationship between the Planned PopVLS and its component assumptions may help teams troubleshoot the DataPack if it seems to be setting inappropriate targets. It is noteworthy that in cases where the host country estimates of viral suppression are derived from population-based surveys of viral load that get around incomplete programmatic viral load testing, but programmatic viral load coverage in the country is low, the use of these host country estimates to calculated planned PopVLS without adjustment for VLC may give unexpected results. Unless reliable programmatic Host Country VL data is available, it may be best to leave the columns for H.C. Est. ART Patients Tested for VLS (FY22) and H.C. Est. Virally Suppressed ART Patients (FY22) blank, and then the DataPack will automatically rely on PEPFAR PVLS data including TX_PVLS_N, which represents viral suppression only among those tested for viral load, i.e. it incorporates the level of viral load coverage in the OU. NOTE: The Data Pack will not prevent situations resulting in PopVLS Rate exceeding 100% in a given PSNU, but will flag these cases in Red to highlight when it occurs. Given that these may be a common occurrence in cases of urban PSNUs, they are allowable in the Data Pack, though should be coordinated with PPMs and DUIT Liaisons. 10.3.5 VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT (FY23) is set as follows (rounded to the nearest integer): \\[ {Planned\\ PopVLS\\ Rate\\ (FY23)}\\ \\times \\ ({PLHIV\\ (FY22)}\\ +\\ {Projected New Infections (FY23)}) \\] As is evident here, targeted VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT is set as a function of FY22 estimated PLHIV plus the New Infections projected for FY23. How these projected New Infections specifically impact PEPFAR targets for TX_NEW, HTS_TST_POS, and TX_CURR will be explained in subsequent sections. 10.3.6 _Military Organization Units Due to sensitivities around PopVLS estimates for Military organization units and populations, this data will not be reflected here in the Data Pack. Country Teams should coordinate closely with Department of Defense liaisons who will perform a similar analysis based on available data sources and then directly paste resulting TX_PVLS (N) targets against the Military organization unit, overwriting the formulas in the TX_PVLS (N) column described in the next section. 10.4 TX_PVLS (N) TX_PVLS (N): Number of ART patients with suppressed VL results (&lt;1,000 copies/mL) documented in the medical or laboratory results/LIS within the past 12 months. .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1;

See below for additional steps for these groups. Review FY23 TX_PVLS (N) Routine targets. To make initial adjustments, return to the Planned PopVLS Rate (FY23), Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response (FY23), New Infections (FY23), and PLHIV (FY22). However, at this stage, it is recommended to leave defaults for these in place and review modeled targets for TX_PVLS (N), TX_PVLS (D), TX_NEW, and TX_CURR, paying special attention to TX_NET_NEW (FY23), which will be explained further in the TX_CURR section below. Unfilter _Military organization units and coordinate with DOD SI so they can paste TX_PVLS (N) targets here. In doing so, they may need to adjust targets in other PSNUs as well. See below for additional information. 10.4.3 TX_PVLS (N): Routine (FY23) For both TX_PVLS (N) and TX_PVLS (D), targets are set in the Data Pack only for Routine viral load testing. TX_PVLS (N) targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: \\[ {TX\\_ PVLS.N.Routine}_{t}\\ = \\ {VL\\_SUPPRESSION\\_SUBNAT}_{t}\\ \\times \\\\ \\text{Planned PEPFAR Contribution to HIV Response (FY23)} \\] 10.4.4 _Military Organization Units Due to the sensitive nature of DOD support for foreign government Military organization units, DOD SI teams model and set PSNU-level targets for TX_PVLS (N) separately so they can leverage granular data collected in their protected systems. DOD SI liaisons have authority to overwrite formulas so as to paste targets for Military organization units in the TX_PVLS (N) column of the Data Pack. As needed, they also have permission to coordinate with other interagency representatives to adjust assumptions and targets in other organization units in order to accommodate _Military organization unit targets, which are effectively a cross-section subset of targets across all other PSNUs. 10.4.5 Infants Virally Suppressed Targets for &lt;01 year olds who are virally suppressed are set and modeled separately from all other age groups as an extension of the PMTCT model used on the PMTCT tab of the Data Pack. These are initially set without sex disaggregation on the EID tab of the Data Pack, then equally allocated by male and female to be reflected on the Cascade Tab. As such, it is recommended that &lt;01 year olds be filtered out while working through the remaining sections of this Cascade tab, and reviewed here in the Cascade Tab only once targets on the PMTCT and EID tabs have been fully reviewed. 10.5 TX_PVLS (D) TX_PVLS (D): Number of ART patients with a Viral Load (VL) result documented in the medical or laboratory records/laboratory information system (LIS) within the past 12 months. .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border-width: 0; display: table;

This can be done in the Data Pack in this section, as well as in PAW, DATIM, and Panorama. Yellow highlights in these columns indicate where VLS rates have historically been below the UNAIDS goal of 95%, and red highlights indicate where reported data produces VLS rates above 100%. Review and adjust the FY23 Planned VLS Rate. This defaults to 95%, unless historic Host Country or PEPFAR data shows a higher trend. However, you may adjust these as needed. In many cases, it is recommended to leave modeled assumptions in place and review targets through to the TX_CURR section of this tab, paying special attention to TX_NET_NEW, and then return to this and other assumptions to adjust iteratively. Review TX_PVLS (D) targets for routine viral load testing. See below for additional information. 10.5.3 TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY23) As mentioned above, only Routine Viral Load testing will be targeted in the Data Pack. Within the Data Pack, TX_PVLS (D) targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: \\[ {TX\\_ PVLS.D.Routine}_{t}\\ = \\ \\frac{{TX\\_

In preparation for setting targets for diagnosis rates for both New Infections and those previously Undiagnosed, review historic Host Country estimates of the percent of PLHIV with known HIV Status, and the number of PLHIV who were previously Undiagnosed. Yellow highlights indicate where diagnosis rates appear to be lower than the UNAIDS goal of 95%. Review and adjust the Planned Percent of New Infections to be Diagnosed in FY23. Return to the projected New Infections (FY23) column in the Host Country Context section of this tab to add or adjust New Infections and Incidence Rates as needed. Planned diagnosis rates here default to 95%, unless historic Host Country trends have been higher. In either case, you may adjust this assumption as appropriate. Review historic data about diagnosis rates, and adjust the FY23 Targeted Linkage Rate, which applies both to New Infections and those Previously Infected who are not yet on ART including Undiagnosed and those Previously Diagnosed but not on ART). Note that Linkage Rates set here are also applied to the models used on the PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs in order to maintain linkages between TX_NEW, PMTCT_ART, TB_ART, and VMMC testings linkage to treatment. Adjust the Percent of Recently Initiated on ART who are planned to be Eligible for VLT during FY23. Keep in mind that per MER guidance, individuals must have been on ART for at least 3 months to be eligible for VLT. As such, the default in this column is 70%, though can be adjusted as needed. Also note that this eligibility rate applies to all those planned to be initiated on ART during FY23, whether treatment naive (New Infections, Previously Undiagnosed, or Previously Diagnosed), or those Returning to Treatment. Review historic data about VLT coverage, and adjust the FY23 Planned VLT Coverage Rate. This rate defaults to 95%, though can be adjusted as needed. Coordinate with DOD SI Liaisons to paste targets for FY23 New Infections Initiated on ART, overwriting formulas as needed, and adjusting upstream assumptions for other organization units as needed to reflect the cross-section of DOD targets. Review FY23 targets modeled for New Infections Initiated on ART, Previous Infections to be Initiated on ART, and the Total Initiated on ART. See below for additional detail. Review targets for the FY23 planned Total Eligible for VLT. See below for additional detail. Review the FY23 Final Planned VLT Coverage, which may differ from planned VLT Coverage Rates set in the steps above. Discrepancies can be traced to assumptions set earlier for the PopVLS Rate, the PEPFAR Contribution to the Host Country HIV Response, Diagnosis Rates, Linkage Rates, and Eligibility Rates. 10.6.3 New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23) Based on Incidence Rates and projected New Infections modeled in the Host Country Context section of this tab, this section of the Data Pack models how PEPFAR will support identifying these individuals and linking them to ART. As such, FY23 New Infections Initiated on ART is set as follows, reflecting both diagnosis and linkage to ART: Placeholder for formulas Keep in mind that targets for infants to be initiated on ART, as mentioned above, are set on the EID tab and only reflected here. Also similar to the above, targets for new infections to be initiated on ART in _Military organization units are set and modeled separately by DOD SI liaisons, and will be pasted here in this column. 10.6.4 Previous Infections Initiated on ART (FY23) The above step related to New Infections Initiated on ART (FY23) effectively institutes a floor on the number of individuals who can be considered eligible for VLT, and a cap on the VLT Coverage Rate, regardless of the elgibility and coverage rates set previously. After setting the PopVLS Rate and other assumptions earlier, the Data Pack calculates both TX_PVLS (N) and TX_PVLS (D) targets. Underlying these values are assumptions of VLS_NET_NEW as well. Subsequently, the Data Pack looks to satisfy this VLS_NET_NEW first via those New Infections to be Initiated on ART and Eligible for VLT. Then, if VLS_NET_NEW still remains, the Data Pack assumes the remainder must be filled by initiating on ART those that had been previously infected by otherwise not on ART. This column summarizes the result of that remainder calculation, though in cases where PopVLS Rates lead to exceptionally high VLS_NET_NEW, this remainder is prevented from ever being negative. Placeholder for formulas 10.6.5 Total Eligible for VLT (FY23) The total Eligible for VLT is based first on the total number of individuals in the incoming treatment pool (TX_CURR from the previous years targets), and secondly on the total number of individuals to be Initiated on TX_CURR who are projected to be on ART within the first three quarters of the Fiscal Year. Placeholder for formulas 10.7 TX_NEW TX_NEW: Number of adults and children newly enrolled on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). \\(Part 1 of 2\\) .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important;

Keep in mind that TX_NEW encompasses both those New Infections Initiated on ART, as well as those previously infected initiated on ART who are treatment naive (as opposed to those who returning to treatment). Review and adjust assumptions for the Percent of Previous Infections Initiated on ART who are Treatment Naive (FY23). The default for this column is 100% (i.e., none of those previous infections to be initiated on treatment in FY23 are returning to treatment), though you can adjust this column as appropriate for your context. Review FY23 TX_NEW targets and return to previous steps to adjust assumptions and modeling decisions as necessary. See below for additional information. Again, it is recommended that you filter out infant populations, as these are set separately on the EID tab, and focus on other populations at first. Only once you have confirmed targets for &lt;01 year olds on the EID tab, return to review those targets on the Cascade tab alongside other populations. 10.7.3 TX_NEW Because MER guidance stipulates that TX_NEW is to be used for reporting initiation on ART of those who are treatment naive, TX_NEW may not always be the same as the target for the Total Initiated on ART (FY23) set in the VLT Coverage section previously due to portions of the total number initiated that may be comprised of individuals who are returning to treatment. 10.8 TX_CURR TX_CURR: Number of adults and children

into DATIM from this section: TX_CURR (FY23) \\(TX\\_CURR.T\\) 10.8.2 Instructions Review and adjust assumptions for Targeted Retention Rates, both for those Initiated on ART during FY23, and those Already on ART at the start of FY23. The default for each of these is 98%, though you may adjust these as needed. Return to the PEPFAR FY22 Targets Cascade section to review the incoming Treatment Cohort, which often times comprises the bulk of TX_CURR targets set in this section. Return to the VLT Coverage section to review targets for the Total Initiated on ART (FY23). Review targets for TX_CURR (FY23), which is based on the incoming Treatment Cohort, the Total Initiated on ART (FY23), and related retention rates for each. Review historic TX_NET_NEW planned during the previous COP, as well as targeted TX_NET_NEW resulting from targets modeled in this Data Pack for the upcoming Fiscal Year. In some cases, negative TX_NET_NEW may result, and may not necessarily indicate quality failure, but will be highlighted red to encourage intentional discussion about these cases. It may be necessary to return to previous sections at this point to adjust assumptions. This review and adjustment process may be iterative, and may also depend on targets set in the PMTCT, TB, and VMMC tabs as well. 10.9 TX_CURR_SUBNAT .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important;

Return and review PEPFAR targets for TX_CURR (FY23). Targets for TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY23) are set in this section by extrapolating PEPFAR TX_CURR targets to a broader context based on PEPFARs planned contribution to the Host Country HIV Response (FY23). Review the historic estimated Population ART Coverage (the total on ART, divided by the total PLHIV). Review the Planned Population ART Coverage for the upcoming Fiscal Year, based on all the targets set to this point. As needed, return to previous sections to adjust assumptions in order to influence this column, especially assumptions related to TX_CURR and TX_CURR_SUBNAT. 10.10 PEPFAR Testing .tabwid table{

Among this second cohort, one portion may have been previously undiagnosed, while another previously diagnosed but not on ART. In this section, review and adjust assumptions to indicate what percent of those previously living with HIV had been Previously Diagnosed, as opposed to New Diagnoses. Review historic trends from FY22 targets for the Percent of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX, and determine how to adjust this percentage for FY23 targets. Review total testing targets (HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS) for FY23. Where necessary, return to previous assumptions and adjust appropriately. Review FY23 targets for HTS_INDEX Positive and adjust the Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTX_INDEX for FY23 as necessary. Review FY23 targets for PMTCT_STAT New Positives and HTS_TST Post ANC1 New Positives and navigate to the PMTCT tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY23 targets for TB_STAT New Positives and navigate to the TB tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY23 targets for VMMC_CIRC Tested Positives and navigate to the VMMC tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY23 targets for PMTCT_HEI_POS and navigate to the EID tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. For infants under 1 year old, 100% of testing targets should come through PMTCT_HEI_POS. See below for additional information. Review FY23 targets for HTS_TST_POS from All Other Modalities and navigate to the HTS tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review percentage contributions toward FY23 targeted Total Positives from HTS_INDEX, PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC, PMTCT_HEI_POS, and All Other Modalities. Red highlights across these columns indicate cases where targets have been over- or under-distributed across modalities. See below for additional information about reconciling discrepancies among these modalities. 10.10.3 Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX Unlike in past years, the COP22 Data Pack initially sets the percentage of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX based on the percentage used in the previous years targets, but allows adjustments from this beginning rate as needed. 10.10.4 Testing Rationalization As testing targets are set in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, and EID tabs, these will be reflected here on the Cascade tab to reconcile against those high-level testing targets set following the logic flow in preceding sections. This section of the Cascade tab can serve as a Table of Contents across these tabs as you adjust assumptions and reconcile targets. Similar Testing Rationalization sections also exist in each of these tabs for easier reference. Red highlighting will indicate any case where over- or under-distribution of testing targets across testing modalities has occurred. As these issues arise, determine whether to adjust either TX_NEW or total Testing targets, or related targets in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, or EID tabs. After testing targets have been allocated to PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, and PMTCT_HEI_POS, any remainder will be available for further allocation against other testing modalities in the HTS tab of the Data Pack. 10.10.5 Testing Targets for Infant Populations Similar to other targets for &lt;01 year olds seen on the Cascade Tab, targets for infants identified as HIV-positive are initially set in the EID tab, without sex disaggregation. In reflecting these in the Cascade tab, these values are equally allocated across male and female infants. Per COP Guidance, 100% of these testing targets for infant populations should be accommodated for via PMTCT_HEI_POS, and no other modality. Should any portion of these targets be allocated to any other modality, an alert will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App. Conditional formatting within the Data Pack will also indicate when this has occurred. 10.11 Testing Reference Distribution .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border-width: 0;

This will initially be pre-populated based on historic trends as recorded in DATIM, but may be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%, or under 0%. Review estimated yields among HTS_INDEX contacts newly tested, both for Community and Facility sites. These are initially pre-populated based on historic trends from DATIM, but can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%, or under 0%; yellow highlights indicate cases where yield rates are less than 20% for 15+ year olds. Review modeled targets for the following columns. See below for additional information: COMMUNITY  Contacts Tested, New Positive COMMUNITY  Contacts Tested, New Negative FACILITY Contacts Tested, New Positive FACILITY Contacts Tested, New Negative Review the Actual percent of HTS_TST_POS to come from Index testing, calculated by dividing the sum of Community and Facility HTS_INDEX_POS by the total HTS_TST_POS. 10.12.3 HTS_INDEX Disaggregates In general, HTS_INDEX disaggregates across both Community and Facility sites, and across both Negative and Positive HIV test results, are set by combining HTS_INDEX_POS with the percentages set in steps 1 and 2 above. Targets for HTS_INDEX New Positives in Community Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}\\ = \\ {HTS\\_ INDEX.Pos}_{t}\\ \\times \\\\ {\\%\\ HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ POS\\ identified\\ in\\ Community\\ Sites}_{t} \\] Building from this, targets for HTS_INDEX New Negatives in Community Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ COM.New.Neg}_{t}\\ = \\ \\frac{{HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t}}{\\text{Community New Tested Yield}_{t}}\\ - \\\\ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t} \\] Alternatively, targets for HTS_INDEX New Positives in Facility Sites are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ FAC.New.Pos}_{t}\\ = \\ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ POS}_{t}\\ - \\\\ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ COM.New.Pos}_{t} \\] And finally, targets for HTS_INDEX New Negatives in Community Sites are set as follows: \\[ {HTS\\_ INDEX\\_ FAC.New.Neg}_{t}\\ = \\ \\frac{{HTS\\_ INDEX\\_

Review and adjust the Expected change in new ANC clients, which should help indicate whether there is an anticipated change in the number of women presenting to ANC compared to FY22. This is defaulted at 0%, though this reflects no suggestion of strategy from S/GAC. Adjust these growth rates to reflect intentional, data-driven, strategic programming. Values can be negative or positive percentages in this column, which will decrease or increase the FY23 target for PMTCT_STAT (D) respectively. (If the expected number of women presenting in ANC for FY22 is the same as FY21, the value in column F would be 0%. If it increased by 50%, the value would be 50%. If the number should decrease by 20%, enter -20%.) Review FY23 targets for PMTCT_STAT (D), which is calculated by multiplying the Expected change in new ANC clients (set in step 2) by the lesser of either the Host Country PMTCT_STAT_SUBNAT (D) - # New ANC clients (FY22) set in the Host Country Context section, or the PMTCT_STAT (D) FY22 targets from DATIM. In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in this column. 11.3 PMTCT: PMTCT_STAT_SUBNAT (D) .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px

Adjust this column and modify the proportion to match COP21 PMTCT strategy and goals. Review FY21 Results for (a) Estimated % ANC1 clients with already Known HIV Positive status, and (b) Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients. Review FY23 projections for (a) Estimated % ANC1 clients with already Known HIV Positive status, and (b) Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients. These data default to remain static from related FY22 rates added to the Host Country Context section of this tab. Where these are unavailable, these instead use FY21 results trends. In either case, these can be adjusted as necessary with approval by your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages different from FY21 results. See below for additional information. Review Total PMTCT_STAT (N), which will display the numerator value for PMTCT_STAT based on the multiplication of PMTCT_STAT (D) and the Targeted testing coverage of ANC1 clients (FY23). To make changes to the PMTCT numerator, adjust either the PMTCT denominator or the desired testing coverage. Review PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive, which will be calculated based on multiplying Total PMTCT_STAT (N) by the Estimated percent of ANC1 clients already Known HIV Positive. Review PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positive, which will be calculated based on first removing the PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive cohort from Total PMTCT_STAT (N), then by multiplying this value by the Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients. Review PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Negative, which will be calculated as the remainder of Total PMTCT_STAT (N) less both PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive and PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positive. 11.4.3 FY23 Projected Known Positivity and New Positivity Rates In projecting rates of Known and New positivity for PMTCT_STAT ANC1 clients, the COP21 DataPack relies first upon Host Country Context estimates, provided by Spectrum or another approved source, and where this data is unavailable, upon PEPFAR FY21 results obtained from DATIM on the date of the DataPacks generation, as documented on the Home tab. These rates are calculated from Host Country Context data as follows: \\[ {Estimated\\ \\%\\ ANC1\\ clients\\ already\\ Known\\ HIV\\ Positive}_{t}\\ = \\\\ \\frac{{PMTCT\\_ STAT\\_ SUBNAT.N.Known.Pos.}_{t - 1}}{{PMTCT\\_ STAT\\_ SUBNAT.D}_{t - 1}} \\] \\[ {Estimated\\ Positivity\\ Rate\\ among\\ Newly\\ Tested\\ ANC1\\ clients}_{t}\\ = \\\\ \\frac{{PMTCT\\_ STAT\\_

11.6.2 Instructions Review Targeted ART Linkage Rate for linkage between PMTCT_STAT (N) Newly Tested, Positive and PMTCT_ART New on ART. This rate is locked in step with ART Linkage Rates set on the Cascade Tab, which default to 95%; return to that tab to adjust this rate, though note that this will alter linkage rates across all modalities. Review modeled targets for PMTCT_ART (N) Already on ART. For the purposes of COP21 target setting in the DataPack, FY23 targets for PMTCT_ART Already on ART are set assuming that 100% of those ANC1 clients with already known HIV positive status are already on ART. Review modeled targets for PMTCT_ART New on ART, which is calculated by multiplying PMTCT_STAT (N) Newly Tested, Positive by the Targeted ART Linkage Rate. 11.7 PMTCT: PMTCT_ART_SUBNAT .tabwid table{

Review and adjust the Yield for PMTCT Post ANC1 HIV testing, which will initially be pre-populated based on FY21 results from DATIM, but can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100% or under 0%. Review Targeted ART Linkage Rates for linkage between HTS_TST: PMTCT Post ANC1, Positive and TX_NEW. This rate is locked in step with ART Linkage Rates set on the Cascade Tab, which default to 95%; return to that tab to adjust this rate, though note that this will alter linkage rates across all modalities. Review targets for HTS_TST: PMTCT Post ANC1, Positive, which are set by multiplying Total eligible for Post ANC1 retesting, set in step 1, by the Yield rate set in step 2. Review targets for HTS_TST: PMTCT Post ANC1, Negative, which are set by subtracting HTS_TST: PMTCT Post ANC1, Positive from the Total eligible for Post ANC1 retesting set in step 1. Review modeled data for those tested and found positive for HIV post ANC1 who are linked to ART, set by multiplying those found positive by the Targeted ART Linkage Rate set in step 3, rounded to the nearest integer. 11.9 PMTCT: Testing Rationalization .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border-width: 0;

This column serves as the starting point of the EID modeling process on the EID tab. For more information about the role of this data relative to EID targets, see that section of this User Guide. Use the remainder of this section of the PMTCT tab to analyze how PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positives fit within the context of an overall testing strategy. In particular, consider how this modality contributes to total HTS_TST_POS in relation to HTS_INDEX, TB_STAT, and all other HTS modalities. Review any cases where this section is highlighted red, indicating over- or under-allocation of HTS_TST_POS targets across contributing modalities. While these allocation issues may be more the result of a different modality(ies), analysis of these to confirm no adjustments to PMTCT_STAT are warranted may prevent issues and additional work in other sections of the DataPack. Return to other tabs of the DataPack where issues flagged in this section require adjustment of either total HTS_TST_POS targets, or targets via other modalities. Similar Testing Rationalization sections can be also found in each of these other tabs of the DataPack. You may also use hyperlinks in column headers in this section to quickly navigate to the most relevant section of the DataPack.

12.1.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: \\({\\bf \\leq 02 mo}\\) \\(PMTCT\\_EID.N.2.T\\) \\({\\bf 02-12 mo}\\) \\(PMTCT\\_EID.N.12.T\\) 12.1.2 Instructions The PMTCT_EID indicator measures the extent to which HIV-exposed infants receive a first virologic HIV test to determine their HIV status by either 2 months or 12 months of age. Ideally, 80% of infants should be tested within the first two months, and 90-95% within the first twelve months. Review and adjust the assumptions for Targeted % HIV exposed infants tested by 2 mo (%) and Targeted % HIV exposed infants tested by 12 mo (inclusive of tested by 2 mo) (%). These will be set at a default of 95% and 95%, respectively. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages less than these default percentages. Review the Estimated number of infants born to HIV-positive women. In absence of granular, reliable, widespread data to estimate rates of multiple births, still births, or infant mortality, this statistic is approximated using the total number of HIV-positive women presenting to ANC (column Total PMTCT: Positives (From ANC1 &amp; Post ANC1) of the PMTCT tab). For more information about the assumptions underlying this data, see the section of this User Guide about the PMTCT tab. Review modeled targets for \\(\\leq\\) 02 mo and 02 - 12 mo PMTCT_EID, which are based on the proportions of HIV exposed infants (reflected in step 2) to be tested by 2 months and by 12 months (set in step 1). Return to steps 1 and 2 to make adjustments to the assumptions driving these two sets of targets. 12.2 EID: PMTCT_HEI_POS (N) PMTCT_HEI_POS (N): Number of HIV-infected infants identified in the reporting period, whose diagnostic sample was collected by 12 months of age. .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;

These data reflect data as reported currently in DATIM. Review and adjust assumptions for FY23 projections of Estimated Positivity Rates both for infants tested before 2 months old, and those tested between 2 and 12 months old. These data default to the same as those rates set in step 1, but can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100% or less than 0%; yellow highlights indicate percentages that differ from those set in step 1. Review Targeted proportion of HIV-infected infants linked to ART. This rate is defaulted to 95%. Review Targeted TX Retention Rate (FY23) (%) which will default to 98%. Review Targeted % Eligible for VLS Testing (FY23) (%) which will default to 70%. Review Targeted % Eligible with Access to VLS Testing (FY23) (%) which will default to 100%. Review Targeted VL Suppression Rate (FY23) (%) which will default to 95%. Review Total HIV infected infants identified which will be the product of PMTCT_EID set in the previous section, multiplied by the Estimated Positivity Rates set in this section, summed across both PMTCT_EID age disaggregates. Please see below for a detailed formula of the calculation. Review HIV+ infants linked to ART (FY23) which is the product of Total HIV infected infants identified and Targeted ART Linkage Rate (FY23) (%)from Step 3. Adjust this value with column L. This will be referenced back to the Cascade tab for the &lt;01 age group. Review HIV+ infants retained on ART at end of FY23 which is the product of HIV+ infants linked to ART (FY23) and Targeted TX Retention Rate (FY23) (%) from Step 4. Adjust this value with column M. This will be referenced back to the Cascade tab for the &lt;01 age group. Review HIV+ infants tested for VLS (FY23) which is the product of HIV+ infants linked to ART (FY23) with both Review Targeted % Eligible for VLS Testing (FY23) (%) from Step 5 and Targeted % Eligible with Access to VLS Testing (FY23) (%) from Step 6. Adjust this value with columns N and O. This will be referenced back to the Cascade tab for the &lt;01 age group. Lastly, review HIV+ infants Virally Suppressed (FY23) which is the product of HIV+ infants tested for VLS (FY23) and Targeted VL Suppression Rate (FY23) (%) from Step 7. Adjust this value with columns P. This will be referenced back to the Cascade tab for the &lt;01 age group. 12.2.3 PMTCT_HEI_POS (FY22) To calculate the total number of HIV-infected infants to be tested and identified, the DataPack

will be imported into DATIM from this section: TB_STAT (D) \\(TB\\_STAT.D.T\\) 13.1.2 Instructions For historical context, review FY22 targets for TB_STAT (D), including in the DataPack reflective of data reported in DATIM. Review and adjust the Estimated Change in Incidence to reflect most reliable projections of TB trends into FY23. This value defaults to 0%, though this should not be interpreted as a suggested epidemiological estimate. If the incidence of TB is expected to remain unchanged from FY22, this value should remain at 0%; if the incidence is expected to double, the cell should read 100%. Review FY23 Targets for TB_STAT (D) and return to step 2 to adjust driving assumptions as necessary. In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in this column. 13.2 TB: TB_STAT (N) TB_STAT (N): Number of new and relapsed TB cases with documented HIV status, during the reporting period. .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border-width:

Review and adjust Targeted TB_STAT Coverage. This defaults to 100%, reflecting that 100% of new and relapsed TB cases know their HIV status, but this rate can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages under 100%. Review FY21 Results for (a) Estimated % TB clients with already Known HIV Positive status, and (b) Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested TB clients. Review FY23 projections for (a) Estimated % TB clients with already Known HIV Positive status, and (b) Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested TB clients. These data default to remain static from FY21 results trends, but can be adjusted as necessary. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages different from FY21 results. Review modeled targets for Total TB_STAT (N), Known HIV Status, Positive, Newly Tested, Positive, and Newly Tested, Negative, and return to steps 1-4 to adjust driving assumptions as needed. See below for additional information. 13.2.3 Total TB_STAT (N) Total TB_STAT (N) targets are modeled as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {TB\\_ STAT.N}_{t}\\ = \\ {TB\\_ STAT.D}_{t}\\

In particular, consider how this modality contributes to total HTS_TST_POS in relation to HTS_INDEX, PMTCT_STAT, Post ANC1 testing, VMMC_CIRC, and all other HTS modalities. Review any cases where this section is highlighted red, indicating over- or under-allocation of HTS_TST_POS targets across contributing modalities. While these allocation issues may be more the result of a different modality(ies), analysis of these to confirm no adjustments to TB_STAT are warranted may prevent issues and additional work in other sections of the DataPack. Return to other tabs of the DataPack where issues flagged in this section require adjustment of either total HTS_TST_POS targets, or targets via other modalities. Similar Testing Rationalization sections can be also found in each of these other tabs of the DataPack. You may also use hyperlinks in column headers in this section to quickly navigate to the most relevant section of the DataPack.

Follow hyperlinks to navigate to the source of this data: Host Country Estimated Male Population (FY22) Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY22) Host Country Estimated HIV Prevalence (FY22) Host Country Estimated TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22) Host Country Estimated ART Coverage (FY22) Host Country Est. PopVLS Rate (VLS/PLHIV) (FY22) (%) If using Spectrum as the source for Host Country Context data, the following columns will initially be populated based on data from the Spectrum export dataset added to the Spectrum tab of the DataPack. Review these and return to Spectrum to adjust assumptions there as needed. With approval by your PPM and assigned DUIT Liaison, you may also identify and use another source for this data. Host Country VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT (FY22) Host Country VMMC_TOTALCIRC_SUBNAT (FY22) Review Host Country Estimated VMMC Coverage (FY22), which is calculated by dividing the FY22 Host Country Estimated VMMC_TOTALCIRC_SUBNAT by the FY22 Host Country Estimated Male Population. Review Targeted Host Country VMMC Coverage (FY23), which is initially set to 80% per PEPFAR VMMC coverage goals, but you may adjust this based on PEPFAR Country-specific VMMC strategies and goals. Note that this statistic represents the targeted VMMC coverage to be achieved by October 2022. Review modeled FY23 targets for Host Country VMMC_TOTALCIRC_SUBNAT and VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT. Return to steps 1-4 to adjust underlying assumptions as needed. 14.2 VMMC: VMMC_CIRC VMMC_CIRC: Number of males circumcised as part of the voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) for HIV prevention program within the reporting period. Note: For FY23 targets, males less than 15 years old will not be eligible for PEPFAR-supported VMMC services. .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1;

VMMC_CIRC HIV Positive \\(VMMC\\_CIRC.Pos.T\\) VMMC_CIRC HIV Negative \\(VMMC\\_CIRC.Neg.T\\) 14.2.2 Instructions For historical context, review FY21 results and FY22 targets for PEPFAR VMMC_CIRC, supplied in the DataPack as an export from data currently reported in DATIM. Review the FY22 estimated PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT, calculated by dividing FY22 PEPFAR VMMC_CIRC targets by the projected FY22 Host Country VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT. Review the FY23 PEPFAR coverage of Host Country VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT, which is initially set equal to the FY22 estimated coverage rate set in step 2, but can be adjusted as needed. For Military SNUs only, adjust the FY22 to FY23 Change in VMMC_CIRC. For Military SNUs, this defaults to zero, but can be adjusted to match strategic programming as necessary. Review FY21 results for Observed Indeterminate/Not Tested Rate and Observed Positivity Rate among those VMMC clients newly tested for HIV, both of which are obtained from DATIM. Review and adjust FY23 projections for Estimated Indeterminate/Not Tested Rate and Estimated Positivity Rate among VMMC clients newly tested for HIV. Both of these estimates are initially set equal to their counterpart set in step 5, but can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights in either indicate percentages above 100% or below 0%; yellow highlights in the Estimated Positivity Rate column indicate yields greater than 1%. Review Targeted ART Linkage Rate for linkage between VMMC_CIRC: HIV Positive and TX_NEW. This rate is locked in step with ART Linkage Rates set on the Cascade Tab, which default to 95%; return to that tab to adjust this rate, though note that this will alter linkage rates across all modalities. Review modeled targets for Total VMMC_CIRC. See below for more information. Return to steps 1-4 and the previous section for VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT to adjust assumptions driving this target. Review modeled targets for VMMC_CIRC Indeterminate/Note Tested, HIV Positive, and HIV Negative. See below for additional information about each of these. Finally, review modeled data for those identified HIV positive via VMMC projected to be linked to ART, which is set by multiplying those identified HIV positive by the ART linkage rate reviewed in step 7. 14.2.3 Total VMMC_CIRC (FY23) For Military organization units, FY23 targets for Total VMMC_CIRC is set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {VMMC\\_ CIRC}_{t}\\ = \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC}_{t - 1}\\ \\times \\ (1\\ + \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Change.Military}_{t}) \\] For all other organization units, FY23 targets for Total VMMC_CIRC are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {VMMC\\_ CIRC}_{t}\\ = \\ {Targeted\\ Host\\ Country\\ VMMC\\_ CIRC\\_ SUBNAT}_{t}\\ \\times \\\\ {PEPFAR\\ Coverage\\ of\\ Host\\ Country\\ VMMC\\_ CIRC\\_ SUBNAT}_{t} \\] 14.2.4 VMMC_CIRC Disaggregates (FY23) In disaggregating total VMMC_CIRC for FY23 Targets, the DataPack will first set targets for those projected to have indeterminate HIV testing results or to deny testing, then targets for those identified positive, and finally those negative. To set targets for Indeterminate/Not Tested, the DataPack will use the following formula, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Unk}_{t}\\ = \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC}_{t}\\ \\times \\ {Est.\\ Indeterminate}/{Not\\ Tested\\ Rate}_{t} \\] For VMMC_CIRC HIV Positive, the DataPack will set targets as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Pos}_{t}\\ = \\ ({VMMC\\_ CIRC}_{t}\\ - \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Unk}_{t})\\ \\times \\ \\text{Est. Positivity Rate}_{t} \\] And finally, VMMC_CIRC HIV Negative targets will be set as a remainder function, as follows: \\[ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Neg}_{t}\\ = \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC}_{t}\\ - \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Unk}_{t}\\ - \\ {VMMC\\_ CIRC.Pos}_{t} \\] 14.3 VMMC: ART Linkage .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;

In particular, consider how this modality contributes to total HTS_TST_POS in relation to HTS_INDEX, TB_STAT, and all other HTS modalities. Review any cases where this section is highlighted red, indicating over- or under-allocation of HTS_TST_POS targets across contributing modalities. While these allocation issues may be more the result of a different modality(ies), analysis of these to confirm no adjustments to VMMC_CIRC are warranted may prevent issues and additional work in other sections of the DataPack. Return to other tabs of the DataPack where issues flagged in this section require adjustment of either total HTS_TST_POS targets, or targets via other modalities. Similar Testing Rationalization sections can be also found in each of these other tabs of the DataPack. You may also use hyperlinks in column headers in this section to quickly navigate to the most relevant section of the DataPack.

This tab is provided to facilitate and inform (1) data-driven program intent or relationships amongst indicators, where relevant, for KP programming and (2) easy review of all KP-related targets by virtue of having all KP-related targets in one tab. Importantly, pre-built algorithms and pre-set assumptions are NOT included in this tab. As such, entry of data into any columns labelled Assumptions or Projected MAY NOT automatically produce targets for the indicators listed. Considerations as you complete and use this tab: As per the COP22 Guidance, baseline data to support target development can come from bio-behavioral surveys (BBS) and size estimates, especially to understand current PLHIV burden and program results. Use the most recent and reliable estimates available where possible. For example, population size estimates and survey data on knowledge of status can inform PP_PREV and subsequent clinical cascade targets. The COP22 Guidance Section 6.6.2 has substantial guidance on expectations of an effective KP program, and should be reviewed before setting KP targets. Where possible and relevant, use FY22 targets and, as available, results to inform FY23 targets (the Assumption column for each indicator in the tab). But remember to consider expectations for scale-up based on current program needs and gaps. That is, FY21 results may not be the most relevant and appropriate base from which to develop FY23 targets. As per COP22 Guidance, OUs should strive to ensure all KPs reached with KP programming (KP_PREV), who do not already know their HIV status are either tested for HIV or actively referred for HIV testing. Therefore, DataPacks will be reviewed for the relationship between KP_PREV to HTS for KP, and if the relationship is substantially different from one to one, it will be important to discuss rationale and context with Chair and PPM. For clinical cascade indicators (HTS_TST, TX_NEW, etc.), consider the relationship amongst these indicators to ensure rates of linkage to treatment are in alignment with COP22 Guidance (i.e., high rates of linkage across all populations). Recognize that Key Population disaggregates are a SUBSET of the regular Age/Sex disaggregates. Each PSNU must have a total of relevant Age/Sex disaggregates of the same indicator for targeting process to be correct (e.g., 15+ Men for MSM). This is also an important factor to consider on the PSNU x IM tab. You may construct additional formulae in the far right of the tab to check this, but it will also be checked by the validation apps and the KP Validation tab. Therefore we have moved the KP tab earlier in the DataPack, and suggest that you start the KP tab early in the DataPack process, and regularly compare against Cascade, HTS, and PrEP tabs. Also note that IMs that do not provide actual clinical services cannot report TX_NEW or TX_CURR. While those IMs should track linkage in their own data systems, there is no relevant MER indicator for that data. 15.1 KP: KP_ESTIMATES .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important;

currently reported in DATIM. Manually enter FY23 PrEP_CT targets in the column titled, PrEP_CT - KeyPop (FY23). NOTE: The PrEP_CT targets here on the KP tab are not linked to those on the PrEP tab, but should nonetheless represent a subset of the total PrEP_CT targets. Be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure total population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the PrEP tab. It may in fact be easier to set KP PrEP targets, other PrEP targets (like AGYW), and then set the general PrEP target. NOTE: Historical PrEP_CURR targets and results are provided for context, but do not necessarily directly inform the targets for the new indicator PrEP_CT. See PrEP_CT on PrEP tab. 15.3 KP: PrEP_NEW PrEP_NEW: Number of individuals who have been newly enrolled on antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection in the reporting

Manually enter FY23 PrEP_NEW targets in the column titled, PrEP_NEW - KeyPop (FY23). NOTE: PrEP_NEW targets here on the KP tab are not linked to those on the PrEP tab, but should nonetheless represent a subset of the total PrEP_NEW targets. Be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure total population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the PrEP tab. It may in fact be easier to set KP PrEP targets, other PrEP targets (like AGYW), and then set the general PrEP target. 15.4 KP: KP_PREV KP_PREV: Number of key populations reached with individual

Targets), which will be imported from DATIM for &gt; reference. Manually enter TX_CURR targets in the column titled, TX_CURR - &gt; KeyPop (FY23). Be prepared to explain target setting processes &gt; and justify variations from previous years if asked during or &gt; prior to COP meetings. Review TX_NET_NEW - KeyPop (FY23), which will be set by taking the &gt; difference between TX_CURR - KeyPop (FY23) and TX_CURR - KeyPop &gt; (FY22 Targets) and be used as further reference in setting KP &gt; TX_NEW. NOTE: TX_CURR targets here on the KP tab are not linked to those on the Cascade tab, but should nonetheless represent a subset of the total TX_CURR targets. Be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure total population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the Cascade tab. 15.6 KP: TX_NEW

Review and adjust the columns Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART Initiation (FY23) (%), Targeted Retention Rate - Already on ART (FY23) (%), and Targeted Retention Rate - New on ART (FY23) (%), which will be prepopulated with 100%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These columns serve similar roles along the KP Cascade as seen on the Cascade tab. Review modeled FY23 targets for TX_NEW  KeyPop, which are initially set by multiplying the FY23 target for TX_CURR  KeyPop by first the Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART Initiation (FY23) (%), and then the Targeted Retention Rate - New on ART (FY23) (%). However, due to wide variation in KP programming, this value can be overwritten and manually adjusted as needed without further approval from PPMs or DUIT Liaisons. NOTE: TX_NEW targets here on the KP tab are not linked to those on the Cascade tab, but should nonetheless represent a subset of the total TX_NEW targets. Be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure total population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the Cascade tab. 15.7 KP:

into DATIM from this section: TX_PVLS (D) - KeyPop (FY23) \\(TX\\_PVLS.D.KP.T\\) TX_PVLS (N) - KeyPop (FY23) \\(TX\\_PVLS.N.KP.T\\) 15.7.2 Instructions Review and adjust the columns % of TX_NEW Eligible for VL Test (FY23) (%) and Proportion of eligible w/ access to VL testing (FY23) (%), which will be prepopulated with 70% and 100%, respectively. These columns serve similar roles along the KP Cascade as seen on the Cascade tab. Review modeled targets for TX_PVLS (D) - KeyPop (FY23), which will initially be set by multiplying the FY23 target TX_NEW  KeyPop first by % of TX_NEW Eligible for VL Test (FY23) (%) and then by Proportion of eligible w/ access to VL testing (FY23) (%). However, due to wide variation in KP programming, this value can be overwritten and manually adjusted as needed without further approval from PPMs or DUIT Liaisons. Review and adjust the Targeted VL Suppression Rate (FY23) (%), which is set at a default 95% for all OUs, but can be changed with permission from your PPM and DUIT Liaisons. Decreasing the targeted suppression rate to any value below 95% will highlight the cell in Yellow, and in Red should it exceed 100% or drop below 0%. Review modeled targets for TX_PVLS (N)  KeyPop (FY23) (%), which will initially be set by multiplying the Denominator Target for TX_PVLS  KeyPop by the Targeted VL Suppression Rate (FY23) (%). NOTE: The KP tab TX_PVLS (D) and TX_PVLS (N) are not linked to the Cascade tab, therefore be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure Key Population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the Cascade tab. 15.8 KP: HTS_TST HTS_TST: Number of individuals who received HIV Testing Services (HTS) and received their test

KeyPop, Negative (FY23) \\(HTS\\_TST.KP.Neg.T\\) 15.8.2 Instructions Review TX_NEW from Previously Diagnosed (FY23) (%), which will come prepopulated at 0%, but can be adjusted as needed. Note that this column serves a similar role along the KP Cascade as seen in the Cascade tab. Review the number of TX_NEW from Previously Diagnosed (FY23), which is calculated by multiplying the rate from Step 1 by TX_NEW - KeyPop (FY23). Return to Step 1 to adjust this value. Review TX_NEW from all other sources (FY23), which will be set taking the difference of TX_NEW - KeyPop (FY23) and TX_NEW from Previously Diagnosed (FY23). The FY22 Targets for HTS_TST KeyPop Positive and Negative will be pulled from DATIM into this tab for added reference. Review and adjust the Targeted ART Linkage Rate (FY23) (%), which is set at a default of 95% for all OUs. Change this value as needed, however, you must seek permission from your assigned PPM and DUIT Liaisons before decreasing the targeted suppression rate to any value below 95%. Red highlights in this column indicate percentages above 100% or below 0%; yellow highlights indicate percentages that have been altered to drop below 95%. Set HTS_TST Yield (FY23) (%) which will resemble the Yield % that was set in the various modalities of the HTS tab and should be approached similarly. Review modeled FY23 targets for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positive, which are the product of TX_NEW from all other sources (FY23) and the rate set in Targeted ART Linkage Rate (FY23) (%). However, due to wide variation in KP programming, this value can be overwritten and manually adjusted as needed without further approval from PPMs or DUIT Liaisons. Lastly, review the modeled FY23 Targets for HTS_TST KeyPop, Negative, which will be calculated by first dividing the FY23 target for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positive by the Yield set in Step 5, and then subtracting the FY23 target for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positive. Due to wide variation in KP programming, this value can be overwritten and manually adjusted as needed without further approval from PPMs or DUIT Liaisons. NOTE: This HTS_TST on the KP tab is not linked to the HTS tab, therefore be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure Key Population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the Cascade tab. 15.9 KP: HTS_RECENT HTS_RECENT: Number of newly diagnosed HIV-positive persons aged \\(\\geq\\) 15 years with a test for recent infection result

default of 100%. This assumption resembles that of the % of Positives used to help set targets in the HTS_RECENT tab. Red highlights in this column indicate percentages over 100% or under 0%; yellow highlights indicate percentages that have been changed to be less than 100%. Review and adjust the modeled FY23 targets for HTS_RECENT - KeyPop, which are the product of the rate set in step 1, and the FY23 Targets for HTS_TST KeyPop, Positives. NOTE: HTS_RECENT KeyPop is not linked to the HTS_RECENT tab. Be sure to review KP targets against total population targets in the KP Validation tab to ensure Key Population targets do not exceed total population targets set on the HTS_RECENT tab. 15.10 KP:

The positivity yield should be between 15 and 40% among adults and there are further requirements for the SGAC accepted proportion of positives coming from the index testing modality. Users should reference the COP 2022 Guidance document for the required parameters based on TX coverage. Review data for what percent of HTS_TST_POS comes from modalities set in other sections or tabs of the DataPack. Note that to adjust these allocations, you must return to the section or tab of the DataPack where these are initially set. Hyperlinks in column headers can help you navigate to the exact column where this occurs. DO NOT adjust allocation percentages for these gray columns in this section of the HTS tab as this will NOT affect any final targets and will break linkages between this tab and source data. These modalities to be reviewed, but adjusted elsewhere include: HTS_INDEX_COM_POS (FY23) HTS_INDEX_FAC_POS (FY23) PMTCT_STAT: New Positives (FY23) HTS_TST PMTCT Post ANC1: Positives (FY23) TB_STAT: New Positives (FY23) VMMC_CIRC: HIV Positive (FY23) Review and adjust planned percentage contributions to HTS_TST_POS from all other HTS modalities, which will initially be populated based on trends seen in FY22 targets, but can be adjusted as needed to align with COP22 - FY23 testing strategies. Note that as you adjust these allocation percentages, the number of projected individuals to be identified HIV positive will change in the corresponding modality block to the right. These modalities to be adjusted in this section include: Facility  Inpatient (FY23) Facility  Pediatric (FY23) Facility  Malnutrition (FY23) Facility  STI Clinic (FY23) Facility  Emergency (FY23) Facility  Other PITC (FY23) Facility  VCT (FY23) Facility - SNS (FY23) Community  Mobile (FY23) Community - SNS (FY23) Community - Other (FY23) Use the Distribution Check column to confirm that distributions of HTS_TST_POS across all HTS modalities do not result in over- or under-allocation. Where this check column is either greater than or less than 100%, red highlights will appear across all modalities, indicating the need to adjust percentage allocations. You MUST resolve all cases where distribution does not sum to 100%. 16.3 HTS: HTS_TST  Modality Yields .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1;

Red highlights indicate percentages over 100% or less than 0%; yellow highlights indicate cases either where: ART Coverage is greater than or equal to 70%, but yields are less than 10%; or ART Coverage is less than 70%, but yields are less than 5%. Review targets for the number of individuals to be tested and found HIV Positive through each modality, using hyperlinks in column headers to return to the Distribution of Positive Tests section of this tab to adjust allocation rates as needed. Note that these are rounded to the nearest integer. See the following section for instructions as to how to identify and resolve rounding errors that may compound across modalities as a result. Review targets for the number of individuals to be tested and found HIV Negative through each modality, which are based on the combination of allocations set in the Distribution of Positive Tests section of this tab, and yield rates set in step 1. Note that these are rounded to the nearest integer. See the following section for instructions as to how to identify and resolve rounding errors that may compound across modalities as a result. In cases where yields are 0%, but Negative test results are targeted, you may manually enter these in this step, though note that this will prevent further dynamic modeling of targets should Positive test result targets be needed in the future. Please also mind conditional formatting guiding entry of these targets against correct ages, which may differ across modality, particularly for Pediatric and Malnutrition modalities. 16.4 HTS: HTS_TST (Total) These calculated columns provide a roll up sum of the total targets set by age, sex and modality in the rest of the HTS tab. This section should serve as a check and will not be uploaded into DATIM. .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;

related to rounding differences caused by allocations of remaining HTS_TST_POS on the HTS tab. See below for additional, detailed instructions. Any cell that is highlighted indicates that it is in a row that users should review the distribution of positives. Review FY23 Targets for individuals to be tested and found HIV negative through PMTCT_STAT, HTS_TST Post ANC1, TB_STAT, and VMMC_CIRC. To adjust these values, follow hyperlinks to the source of data for these columns. Review modeled targets for Total HTS_TST_NEG, Total HTS_TST, and the Aggregate Yield Rate, which is modeled simply by dividing the final HTS_TST_POS total by the total HTS_TST target. 16.4.3 Resolve HTS_TST_POS Rounding Differences In the process of allocating HTS_TST_POS targets across HTS modalities, the multiplication of integer values representing whole people by percentage allocations, followed by rough rounding, often causes slight rounding errors to accumulate across ages, sexes, and geographies. In situations where there may be significantly small HTS_TST_POS targets being spread over multiple HTS modalities, the aggregation of many small rounding errors can lead to large differences in planned and final HTS_TST_POS. This section of the DataPack is built to help identify and resolve these cases, where they occur. Prior to using this section, it is key that all allocations be complete, either in those modalities called out specifically in the Cascade tab, or in the HTS tabs Distribution of Positive Tests section. With this complete, only true rounding error cases will remain to be identified in this section of the DataPack. Cases where rounding errors may have occurred will be highlighted in red formatting in the column titled, HTS_TST_POS difference to adjust; Excel filters may be helpful in narrowing to these rows. By first reviewing and refining allocations in the Cascade tab of the DataPack for overall HTS_INDEX, PMTCT_STAT, HTS_TST PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, and VMMC_CIRC, any rounding errors still present on the HTS tab are more likely the result of distributions decided on this tab across the following modalities: Inpatient (Facility) Pediatric (Facility) Malnutrition (Facility) STI Clinic (Facility) Emergency (Facility) Other PITC (Facility) VCT (Facility) SNS (Facility) Mobile (Community) SNS (Community) Other (Community) The process for resolving rounding errors across these modalities may involve some trial and error. In all cases, but especially for cases where total HTS_TST_POS is small and rounding errors could represent large swings in total targets, it is necessary to determine which modality(ies) should be allocated remainder HTS_TST_POS identified in this section. Iteratively return to the HTS_TST Distribution of Positive Tests section on this HTS tab to adjust allocations, then return to this section to check for lingering rounding remainders. At the culmination of this iterative approach, there should be no values or highlighting remaining in the HTS_TST_POS difference to adjust column of this section. 16.5 HTS: HTS_SELF HTS_SELF (N):

PEPFAR Cervical Cancer Screening countries. For countries that are NOT REQUIRED to report on this indicator, you do not have to complete this section unless you plan to offer cervical cancer-related services as per the relevant MER indicators. To remove all cervical cancer targets, change the value in column Targeted CXCA Screening coverage rate (%) to 0%. For historical context, review FY21 results, FY22 targets, and FY21 Observed CXCA Screen Coverage rates as reported in DATIM, as well as FY23 Targets for TX_CURR from the Cascade tab of the DataPack. Review and adjust Targeted CXCA Screening Coverage Rate (%). Column Targeted CXCA Screening coverage rate (%) will determine the proportion of HIV positive women currently on treatment that will receive cervical cancer screening in COP2120/FY22 implementation year. Each team will have a default value of 50% set in this column as in past years. However, please follow COP21 Guidance and adjust to approximate full coverage of TX_NEW and 25% of already on ART, depending on prior year achievements and any additional country specific guidance from your Chair and PPM. To remove all FY23 cervical cancer targets, set this column to 0%. Review FY23 targets for CXCA_SCRN and return to steps 1 and 2 to adjust. This target is set based on the number of eligible women in the COP 21 TX_CURR cohort multiplied by the Targeted CXCA Screening Coverage Rate.

TColumn Type?assumptiontargetWhat type of data?percentageintegerPrepopulated data?NNEnter or modify data?NNCalculated column?YYLinked column?YY 18.1.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: The # Tested for Recent Infection Target for each modality. 18.1.2 Instructions The HTS_RECENT Tab contains 15 different Modalities for both Facility and Community level targets. Each modality consist of two columns. The first column in each modality is the % of Positives for the specific modality indicator. Each of these columns is prepopulated with a default of 100% for each modality reflecting COP 22 guidance that 100% of patients who test positive for HIV should also receive a recency test. These assumptions may be altered as needed by country teams, but they are conditionally formatted to highlight in Red should the percentage be over 100% and Yellow should they be less than 100%. Review the target column for each of these modalities will be set in the column # Tested for Recent Infection and will be a product of the % of Positives and the Newly Tested, Positive targets that were set in previous tabs that relate to each modality column. For example, the first Modality in this tab PMTCT (Facilty) will take the % of Positives and multiply it by the target that was set in column Newly Tested, Positive from the PMTCT tab. Each of the formulas that are prepopulated for each modality links back to the tab in which the main Newly Tested, Positive target was set. These reference tabs are: Cascade, PMTCT, TB, VMMC, and HTS. 18.2 HTS_RECENT (Total) .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto;

Tested for Recent Infection across all modalities on the HTS_RECENT tab. To adjust individual targets by modality, return to the previous section. In some circumstances, it may also be necessary to return to the Cascade, PMTCT, TB, VMMC, or HTS tabs to adjust the number of HTS_TST_POS coming from each modality. Review Total HTS_TST_POS column which references Final HTS_TST_POS targets on the HTS tab. This column is here for reference only and should not be changed as changed in this column will not be reflected on the HTS tab and will not be imported into DATIM final targets. Finally, review the Aggregate Recency Test Coverage Rate (%) column to assess aggregate recency testing coverage across all modalities. If there are fewer recency tests done than there are HTS_TST_POS, or recency testing coverage is lower than 100%, then the column will be highlighted yellow. If this coverage is greater than 100% the cell will be highlighted Red.

Targets will be set for those New on ART and screened positive for TB as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: \\[ {TX\\_ TB.D.New.Pos}_{t}\\ = \\ {TX\\_ NEW}_{t}\\ \\times \\ {Targeted\\ Coverage:\\ New\\ on\\ ART}_{t}\\ \\times \\\\ {TB\\ Screen\\ Positivity\\ Rate:\\ New\\ on\\ ART}_{t} \\] FY23 targets for those Already on ART, but found negative for TB will be set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: \\[ {TX\\_ TB.D.New.Neg}_{t}\\ = \\ ({TX\\_ NEW}_{t}\\ \\times \\ {Targeted\\ Coverage:\\ New\\ on\\ ART}_{t})\\ - \\\\ {TX\\_ TB.D.New.Pos}_{t} \\] Similarly, targets for those Already on ART and screened positive for TB will be set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: \\[ {TX\\_ TB.D.Already.Pos}_{t}\\ = \\ {TX\\_ CURR}_{t}\\ \\times \\ {Targeted\\ Coverage:\\ Already\\ on\\ ART}_{t}\\ \\times \\\\ {TB\\ Screen\\ Positivity\\ Rate:\\ Already\\ on\\ ART}_{t} \\] And finally, targets for those Already on ART and screened negative for TB will be set as below, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {TX\\_ TB.D.Already.Neg}_{t}\\ = \\ ({TX\\_ CURR}_{t}\\ \\times \\ {Targeted\\ Coverage:\\ Already\\ on\\ ART}_{t})\\ - \\\\ {TX\\_ TB.D.Already.Pos}_{t} \\] ## TX_TB_PREV: TB_PREV (D) TB_PREV (D): Number of ART patients who are expected to complete a course of TB preventive therapy during the reporting period (for programs using continuous IPT, this includes only the patients who are scheduled to complete the first 6 months of therapy). .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1;

Already on ART \\(TB\\_PREV.D.Already.T\\) 19.1.5 Instructions Review Cumulative Previous Completion of TPT (Results FY17-21) as well as TB_PREV (N) - New on ART (FY22 Targets) and TB_PREV (N) - Already on ART (FY22 Targets). These three columns will help calculate Already on ART who have likely completed TPT in last 5 years (FY23) (%). Review Already on ART who have likely completed TPT in last 5 years (FY23) (%) which is the summation of the previous three columns from step 1 above, divided by the TX_CURR (FY22) value from column G of the TX_TB (D) section. Review Est. # Already on ART Eligible for TPT (FY23) which is equivalent to Already on ART, TB Screen - set in the TX_TB (D) section, less the projected number of these who have likely already received TPT in the previous few years. Review both % TPT Initiation Rate - New on ART (FY23) (%) and % TPT Initiation Rate - Already on ART (FY23) (%) which are defaulted to 100%. % TPT Initiation Rate - New on ART (FY23) (%) will flag yellow if it is less than 100% while % TPT Initiation Rate - Already on ART (FY23) (%) will flag if it is set less than 90%. Review modeled targets for TB_PREV (D) New on ART  set by multiplying New on ART, TB Screen - and % TPT Initiation Rate - New on ART (FY23) (%)  and TB_PREV (D) Already on ART  set by multiplying Est.

section: PP_PREV (FY23) \\(PP\\_PREV.T\\) 20.1.2 Instructions FY22 Targets column will come prepopulated with FY22 PP_PREV targets as currently reported in DATIM. Countries will review this data, but should not make changes to it. Though this column does not prevent users from making edits, teams must receive approval from their PPM and assigned DUIT Liaison before doing so. Changes made in this column will NOT be reflected in DATIM. Review and adjust the Expected Change in PP_PREV services (%). This defaults to 0%, though this reflects no suggestion of strategy from S/GAC. Adjust these growth rates to reflect intentional, data-driven, strategic programming. Values can be negative or positive percentages in this column, which will decrease or increase the FY23 target for PP_PREV respectively. PP_PREV (FY23) targets will be set as a growth rate function of the FY22 Targets and the Expected change % set in the previous two columns. To make changes to the COP21 target in this column, increase or decrease the Expected Change in PP_PREV services. In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in these columns.

context, review column Host Country Est. PLHIV (FY22), which will pull from the Cascade tab. Review the DREAMS SNU? column, which will indicate whether an SNU is actively implementing DREAMS activities by using Y for Yes and N for No. This column will come prepopulated based on the most up-to-date, authoritative list of DREAMS SNUs as centrally maintained by PEPFAR O/GAC. To add or remove any SNUs on this list during the COP21 process, notify your assigned PPM, as well as DREAMS liaisons on the PEPFAR Program Quality Team to ensure these changes are reflected in your DataPack. After communicating and documenting these updates centrally, the DataPack Self-Service App will alert to an update in the DREAMS SNU list and provide an updated DataPack with updated data in this DREAMS SNU? column. Note that in the interim, you may manually overwrite or alter flags in this column, though any discrepancies between this column in the DataPack and the centrally-maintained list of DREAMS SNUs will be flagged in the DataPack Self-Service App and must be resolved prior to COP Approval and DATIM import. Review columns FY21 Results and FY22 Targets which will come pre-populated with results and targets from DATIM and will serve as a baseline for COP21 target calculations. Review the column Projected Net Change in OVC_SERV (%), which will be preset with a default rate of 0%. Alter this percent value to either increase or decrease the OVC targets for COP21. Changes in this column will affect the overall OVC_SERV targets reflected in column Total OVC_SERV. Review and adjust the allocation of total OVC_SERV across DREAMS, Preventive, and Comprehensive: For DREAMS, allocations are only allowable where a district is denoted as a DREAMS SNU  to adjust, return to step 2  and for females ages 10 to 17. For Preventive services, allocations are only allowable for adolescents ages 5 to 14. All remaining OVC_SERV is automatically allocated to the Comprehensive service category. Red highlighting in the column, Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV, indicates cases where percentages are over 100% or less 0%. Review and adjust the column Targeted Graduation Rate among Comprehensive (%), which is preset at a default value of 20%, per guidance from O/GAC. Adjust these values as necessary to align with the COP 2021 OVC strategy. Graduation rates can be set at any value between 0-100% but should not be a negative value. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100% or less than 0%; yellow highlights indicate graduation rates less than 20%. Review modeled targets for Total OVC_SERV, which are calculated by applying the net rate of change decided in step 4 by the FY22 target referenced in step 3. In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in this column. Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted by the DREAMS program COP21 implementation. This target is calculated by multiplying the total OVC_SERV target by the Targeted DREAMS % of Total OVC_SERV (%) (FY23) set in step 5. This formula is also dependent on the input into column DREAMS SNU?, which must be marked with a Y to indicate the SNU is in fact a DREAMS SNU in order to set this target (see step 2). Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted by the OVC Preventive program COP21 implementation. This target is calculated by multiplying the total OVC_SERV target by the Targeted Preventive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) (FY23), set in step 5. Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted for graduation from OVC Comprehensive services during COP21 implementation. This target is a calculated by multiplying the Total OVC_SERV target by the Targeted Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) (FY23) and Targeted Graduation Rate among Comprehensive (%) (FY23). Review the targeted number of Active OVC Comprehensive beneficiaries for COP21. The Active OVC Comprehensive target is derived in the DataPack as a remainder of Total OVC_SERV to be served via Comprehensive services, less those captured in the Comprehensive - Graduated target. To make changes to Comprehensive - Active targets in the DataPack, adjust the proportion in the Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) column, as set in step 5. NOTE: There is no denominator for OVC_SERV NOTE: Changing the values here will lead to downstream changes in OVC_HIVSTAT column U. NOTE: Column N Target % Graduation Rate does not include Exited or Transferred Out in Denominator. 21.2 OVC: OVC_HIVSTAT OVC_HIVSTAT: Number of orphans and vulnerable children (&lt;18 years old) with

with reported HIV Status \\(OVC\\_HIVSTAT.T\\)  Note that this data will be aggregated across age group, resulting in one value per PSNU. 21.2.2 Instructions Review the column Targeted % OVC (&lt;18) with reported HIV Status (%) (FY23) which is prepopulated at 100% by default, representing a goal of having 100% of those served via OVC Comprehensive services under 18 years old with reported HIV status. Adjust these values to either increase or decrease the COP22 target value in column # OVC with reported HIV status. Red highlights indicate percentages greater than 100%, or less than 0%; yellow highlighting indicates percentages changed to less than 100%. Review the target value in column # OVC with reported HIV status (FY23), which is calculated by multiplying those allocated to the OVC_SERV Comprehensive services disaggregates, whether Active or Graduated, and also less than 18 years of age. To adjust these targets, return to step 1.

\\(GEND\\_GBV.S.T\\) 22.1.2 Instructions For historical context, review FY22 targets for both the Physical/Emotional Violence and Sexual Violence service types, which are pre-populated from DATIM. Review and adjust the Projected change in GEND_GBV - Physical/Emotional Violence services (%) and Projected change in GEND_GBV - Sexual Violence services (%) columns. These will default to 0%, though this reflects no suggested strategic direction. Review FY23 targets for both the Physical/Emotional Violence and Sexual Violence service types. Each of these is calculated as a function of the expected change rate multiplied by the FY22 target for the related service type. In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in these columns.

Estimated Female Population for FY22, which is referenced from the Cascade tab. Enter values for the Host Country Estimated Number of Vulnerable AGYW projected as of September 2021, as available. These are for reference and not used to model targets in proceeding steps. For context, review FY23 targets for PrEP_NEW, PrEP_CT, PP_PREV, HTS_TST_POS, and HTS_TST, set in other tabs of the DatatPack. For additional context, review FY21 results for AGYW_PREV and Observed Percent Completion as reported in DATIM. Review and adjust assumptions for Projected Net Change in Total AGYW_PREV from FY21 Results (%). This is defaulted to 0%, but can be adjusted as necessary. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages less than 100% but not 0%. Review and adjust assumptions for Targeted Percent Completion. This is defaulted to 60%, but can be adjusted as necessary. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages less than 60%. Review modeled FY23 targets for AGYW_PREV Denominator and Numerator, and return to steps 1-6 to adjust values as necessary. See below for additional information. 23.1.3 AGYW_PREV Denominator (FY23) FY23 targets for AGYW_PREV Denominator are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: \\[ {AGYW\\_ PREV.D}_{t}\\ = \\

imported into DATIM from this section: PREP_CT Continuing on PrEP (FY23) \\(PrEP\\_CT.T\\) 24.2.2 Instructions Think through population specific target of PrEP with in country data, and population specific targets for AGYW, KP, zero-discordant couples and other at risk groups, in line with COP22 Guidance. For each of these populations think through how groups may continue to use PrEP and remain at risk, go off PrEP due to change in risk, or return to PrEP due to a change in risk. Note that PrEP_CT is a revised and different indicator from PrEP_CURR. While PrEP_CURR historical targets and results are provided for context and assistance, they do not necessarily provide direct insight into PrEP_CT targets. Manually enter targets for PrEP_CT (FY23).

25.0.2 Instructions Enter values for column Host Country Estimated KP_MAT_SUBNAT (FY22), as available. Sources for this data should be approved by the PPM and DUIT Liaison assigned to your Country. Review PEPFAR KP_MAT (FY22 Targets), pulled from DATIM as reference for historical context. Review Observed PEPFAR Coverage of KP_MAT_SUBNAT (FY22 Targets), calculated by dividing FY22 PEPFAR KP_MAT targets by Host Country Estimated KP_MAT_SUBNAT (FY22). Review Targeted PEPFAR Coverage of KP_MAT_SUBNAT (FY23) (%) which will pull directly from the previous column for FY22 that was calculated in the last step, but you may edit this as needed. Review and adjust Targeted Growth in KP_MAT (FY23) (%). This will be prepopulated at 0%, but you may adjust this as needed. Review KP_MAT (FY23) which will be the product of PEPFAR KP_MAT (FY22 Targets) multiplied against Targeted Growth in KP_MAT (FY23) (%). In the case services are planned in FY23 where these were not provided in FY22, you may manually enter FY23 targets in these columns. Review Host Country KP_MAT_SUBNAT (FY23) and adjust previous assumptions as needed. The DataPack will model these targets based upon FY23 PEPFAR KP_MAT targets and the Targeted PEPFAR Coverage of KP_MAT_SUBNAT (FY23) (%). "],["26-KP-Validation.html", "26 KP Validation", " 26 KP Validation Each section of the KP_Validation tab looks at each indicator that sets a Key Population target to ensure the total for each of these Key Population disaggregated targets does not exceed the total Female and Male 15+ populations for each PSNU.

Return to those tabs to investigate and adjust values. Changes made in this section of the KP Validation tab WILL NOT affect actual targets set in those tabs. NOTE: Confirm for PrEP indicators that DREAMS age groups are aligned between KP and Total Populations, and ensure there is sufficient excess to target AGYW demographics. Review each column of the KP Targets Validation section. Data for these columns come originally from the KP tab of the DataPack. Return to that tab to investigate and adjust values. Changes made in this section of the KP Validation tab WILL NOT affect actual targets in the KP tab. Review the FSW column and ensure the total in this column does not exceed the total target for Female, 15+ (FY23). Cases where this does occur will be highlighted red. Review the MSM column and ensure the total in this column does not exceed the total target for Male, 15+ (FY23). Cases where this does occur will be highlighted red. Review the final three columns People in prisons and other enclosed settings, PWID, and TG to ensure that the sum of these three columns does not exceed the remainder of KPs  the remainder after subtracting the amounts targeted in the FSW and MSM columns.

To receive and populate a PSNUxIM tab, follow the below instructions. 27.0.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: All mechanism integer value totals All deduplication proportions 27.1 Receiving a PSNU x IM Tab for the First Time Important Note: Adding data to the PSNUxIM tab of your DataPack may cause the the filesize of your DataPack to increase, sometimes significantly. As this may have implications for the performance of your DataPack, it is recommended to run initial validations in the Self-Service App and ensure the DataPack is in a good state of completeness prior to generating the PSNUxIM tab. Although the App will give the option to generate the PSNUxIM tab each time you validate your tool, it is not required to complete this step until you are fully prepared to begin the mechanism allocation process. Upon first receipt, the DataPack will not contain a populated PSNUxIM tab. To receive a populated version of this tab, follow the below instructions: Submit a preliminary DataPack for validation to the self-service validation tool at datapack.DATIM.org. The DataPack Self-Service App will automatically detect that the PSNUxIM tab has not yet been populated and will do so, returning a new copy of the DataPack with all other parts of the DataPack left unaltered, but containing a populated PSNUxIM tab. Note that this new copy of your DataPack will not automatically update any data derived from DATIM used across the rest of the DataPack, such as previous years result or target data. To request a DataPack with updated DATIM data, contact your PPM and assigned DUIT Liaison for approval, then submit a ticket to the DataPack Support Team at DATIM.Zendesk.com. Download the new copy of your DataPack generated by the Self-Service App and make it available to the rest of your team as appropriate. Review the initial PSNUxIM tab for any obvious errors made in the automated generation process. Flag any issues to the DataPack Support Team at DATIM.Zendesk.com. In producing a PSNU x IM tab for the first time, the DataPack Self-Service app will write data and formulas into this tab as follows: Each PSNU. DataPack Indicator Codes, which reference codes used throughout the DataPack hidden in row 14 on each tab. Age, Sex, &amp; Key Population for each sub-population, where specified. Total DataPack Targets, as set in previous tabs of the DataPack. In adding these targets, the DataPack Self-Service App will write formulas allowing dynamic referencing of each target. In cases where additional updates to previous tabs of the DataPack may be necessary, any updates to target values will automatically be updated on this tab in this column. Rollup totals, summing allocated targets across all mechanisms. This column can be helpful in quickly assessing whether DataPack Target totals have been over- or under-allocated across DSD or TA, and IMs. Red highlighting indicates cases where Rollup sums differ from original DataPack Target totals. Percentage totals allocated to a column new in the COP22 Data Pack titled Not PEPFAR, signifying targets that may have been modeled in the DataPack to allow a full picture of services to be demonstrated, but which will likely be implemented by another partner organization separately from PEPFARs support. These values are considered in the Rollup totals to ensure complete allocation, but are dropped in passage to PAW, the Self Service App, and DATIM. Percentage allocations across IMs and DSD or TA, based on FY22 Target proportions as currently reported in DATIM. Note that these are based on a snapshot of DATIM taken at the time this data is originally written into the PSNUxIM tab. These allocation percentages will not automatically update once they have been first written into this tab. See below for how to either adjust existing allocations, or add new IMs and allocations to this section. Possible maximum and minimum Deduplicated Rollup Totals, Deduplicated DSD Totals, and Deduplicated TA Totals. Observed and Targeted Dedupe Resolution strategies as seen in DATIM-reported data for FY22 Targets, or based on allocations chosen in the DataPack. See below for additional information. Duplicated Rollups, summing by DSD, TA, and Total across all allocated mechanisms. These data will automatically update as allocations are adjusted on this tab, or as total targets are adjusted on other tabs. IM-level Target Values, as integers, calculated by multiplying DataPack Target totals by mechanism allocation percentages. 27.2 Adjusting IM Allocations To adjust, remove, and add allocations across Mechanisms in the PSNUxIM tab, follow the below instructions: Review initial allocations written automatically into the DataPack based on patterns observed in FY22 Targets in DATIM. To adjust existing percentages, type over percentages already provided in the DataPack with new percentages reflecting COP22 strategic programming. Note that these allocations are both to distribute targets to mechanisms as well as to distribute them across DSD and TA. In other words, in a case with no deduplication, allocations should sum to 100%, representing how each target will be divided both across mechanisms and by service type. To remove existing percentages, DO NOT DELETE COLUMNS. Instead, either replace the name of a mechanism in row 14 with a new name (following the format #####_DSD or #####_TA) and repurpose or replace the allocations in the rows below it, or delete only those percentage allocations for a given mechanism  but keeping the mechanism name in row 14 the same  effectively withdrawing it from a certain geography or population or program area. To add new mechanisms for allocation, follow the below steps: Unhide the buffer of hidden green columns between pre-populated mechanism columns and the gray columns to the right describing Deduplicated Totals (Columns I  CE). Type the new mechanism name into the green cell in row 14, making sure to also denote the service type, whether DSD or TA. These names must be of the format: #####_DSD, or #####_TA. Do not leave any blank columns between mechanisms. Again, DO NOT DELETE COLUMNS. Confirm that mechanisms added here are entered in FACTS Info, approved, and valid for MER data entry for COP22. While there can be up to a 24 hour delay in synchronizing these mechanisms from FACTS Info to DATIM, as soon as a mechanism is added and approved and valid in FACTS Info, its 4-6 digit numeric code can be entered here in the DataPack, and you can begin allocating targets to this new mechanism. However, note that in order to validate these data using the DataPack Self-Service App, mechanisms must have already been synchronized from FACTS Info to DATIM. Validation alerts in the DataPack Self-Service App will note where this may not be the case. Add allocations in the rows below any new mechanisms, making sure that new and old allocations still aggregate to no less than 100% allocation in all cases, and also no more than 100% allocation where no deduplication occurs. 27.3 Resolving Invalid Mechanism Errors The PSNUxIM tab will only populate with mechanisms that are marked as active for the current COP year in DATIM. Any mechanisms that are manually added to the PSNUxIM tab that are not active and valid will be flagged by the Self-Service App. To ensure a mechanism is valid for the current COP year, go into the COP module in FACTS Info-Next Gen (FI-NG) and check the box for PEPFAR Systems Active Reporting Years for the appropriate COP year. Please note that it may take up to 24 hours for active mechanism flags to be carried over into DATIM and resolve validation errors in the Self-Service App. 27.4 Note on Peace Corps Mechanisms As in COP21, Peace Corps will no longer report targets under their older mechanisms, and will instead report all targets under Management &amp; Operations (M&amp;O) mechanisms. Note that the PSNUxIM tab will initially populate mechanisms and distributions based on previous year targets, so there may be cases where you will need to shift Peace Corps targets to M&amp;O mechanisms from previous mechanisms by changing the IM reference number at the top of the tab to the appropriate M&amp;O IM code. 27.5 Resolving Rounding Errors Due to the combination of multiplication of percentage values against target values coming from other parts of the DataPack, and rounding of all mechanism target values to integers, target values allocated against mechanisms may roll up with some slight difference from DataPack Targets. It may be necessary to iteratively adjust rounding errors and deduplications throughout the IM allocation process, though in general it is a good practice to resolve rounding errors as much as possible before moving on to deduplication. To resolve rounding errors, adjust percentages gradually, as follows: If you had previously unhid the buffer of green Percentage Allocation columns (the section between columns I and CE) while adding new mechanisms, or the Deduplication columns in columns CF to CV, it may be helpful to hide columns in these sections again now to more easily see both Percentage Allocations and Target Values at the same time on your screen. It may also be helpful to review Duplicated Rollup values in columns CW to FS in addition to DataPack Targets in column G so as to consider rounding errors distinctly from the impacts of deduplication. While maintaining overall distribution patterns as intended, gradually adjust percentage allocations under affected mechanisms in columns I through CE to increase or decrease Duplicated Rollups as needed. Note that while all rounding errors should be resolved if possible, a small margin of error around some values is permissible, so long as this does not exceed an absolute value of 2 in either direction of the DataPack Target in column G. 27.6 Performing Deduplication Follow the below steps to perform all Deduplication associated with IM allocations of targets. Note that all deduplication must be performed here in the PSNUxIM tab, and will not be permitted for COP22 targets in DATIM. If you had previously unhid the buffer of green Percentage Allocation columns (columns I  CE), it may be helpful to hide empty columns in this section again now. Review Duplicated Rollups for DSD, TA, and total targets. These are dynamically summed across all mechanism targets allocated in the PSNU x IM tab to the right of these columns. To adjust these totals, return to the Percentage Allocation section. Review TA Deduplication, DSD Deduplication, and Crosswalk Deduplication (recommended in that order for each row): Where only a single mechanism is assigned targets under either DSD or TA (for DSD and TA Deduplication), where deduplicated DSD and TA totals aggregate to less than or equal to DataPack targets (for Crosswalk Deduplication), or where total mechanism targets aggregate to less than or equal to DataPack Targets, gray highlighting in these sections indicates that deduplication is not necessary or permitted. Review allowable ranges for possible deduplicated totals by referencing the SUM and MAX rollup columns. As in the DATIM Deduplication App, SUM values represent cases with zero deduplication, and MAX rollups represent application of the most deduplication possible, resulting in values equivalent to the largest IM target among either the DSD or TA mechanisms (for DSD or TA deduplication), or the larger of either DSD or TA deduplicated totals (for crosswalk deduplication). Review Observed Dedupe Resolutions seen in FY22 Target allocations. These are provided for reference, and indicate which deduplication approach was used in FY22 Target deduplication, performed in the DATIM Deduplication App. For cases where Custom deduplication was used in FY22 Targets, review the Custom Dedupe Allocation observed in FY22 Targets. Percentages here are calculated by dividing the DSD or TA deduplication value (for DSD or TA deduplication) or the sum of Deduplicated DSD and Deduplicated TA (for crosswalk deduplication) by the sum of all mechanisms and deduplication values, across both DSD and TA. As such, these values are all negative or zero, and can be easily compared against target allocation percentages used in columns I  CE. In columns CT for TA, CN for DSD, and CH for Crosswalk, manually type the deduplication resolution approach to be used to resolve deduplication issues, as follows: CUSTOM or custom or Custom SUM or sum or Sum MAX or max or Max Where Custom deduplication is selected, also indicate the percentage allocation to be assigned to the deduplication value in the column to the immediate right. Again, a reminder that these values should all be negative or zero, and represent the proportion of deduplication values relative to the DataPack Target total in column I. Initially upon indicating Custom deduplication, the DataPack will preset this deduplication allocation equal to the value observed in FY22 Targets, if any. You may alter and adjust this value as needed, so long as it is negative or zero. Also note that it is not enough to only type in a percentage deduplication allocation; you must also enter CUSTOM, SUM, or MAX, as explained in the previous step. Note that instead of entering SUM, it is possible to enter CUSTOM but enter a deduplication percentage allocation of 0%; and instead of entering MAX, it is possible to enter CUSTOM but enter a deduplication percentage allocation that results in the equivalent of the MAX value shown in columns CG, CL, or CR. Review the Rollup values in column H for any mismatch against DataPack Targets in column G that may necessitate adjustment of Deduplication allocations. Note that while it is not a strict requirement that percentage allocations across mechanisms and deduplication add to 100%, it is a requirement that integer values add to equal the DataPack Target in column G, ± 2. Red highlights in column H indicate values more than 2 (integer, absolute value) away from the DataPack Targets in column G; yellow highlights indicate values 1 or 2 (integer, absolute value) away from the DataPack Targets column G.

After logging into the app, you can upload a copy of your DataPack, and receive feedback regarding the structure and content of the DataPack. The app will attempt to provide feedback regarding any errors which may prevent the import of your DataPack into DATIM. In general, all errors must be resolved prior to any approval or import of data into DATIM. Warning messages should be carefully reviewed. While these may not prevent import of your data, ignoring them may lead to data quality problems. The app also provides a number of charts and tables to assist with review of your DataPack. Each of these functions will be described in more detail in the remained of this chapter. 28.1 Logging in In order to access the app, you will need to login with your DATIM credentials. If you do not have a DATIM username and password or if your account has been deactivated, please contact DATIM support. 28.2 Uploading a DataPack Once you have logged into the app, choose Browse from the left side pane. Select the DataPack you wish to validate. Please be sure to use an XLSX file! Other formats such as XLSB or ZIP archives of your DataPack are not supported, and cannot be used. Once you file is completely uploaded to the server, the Validate button should become active. 28.3 Validating your DataPack After pressing the Validate button on the left-side pane, the app will perform a number of structural checks on your file. It is critical that the structure of the DataPack matches that which was provided to you. Any tabs or columns which have been removed will result in a parsing error, and these will need to be fixed prior to import. Other checks include: Altered formulas: Generally, formulas should not be altered, but there can be valid programmatic reasons for doing so. These warnings are provided in order to allow those reviewing the DataPack to make a determination as to whether they are valid changes or not. Decimal values: In general, all values (with a few exceptions) should be whole integer numbers. Decimals cannot be imported into DATIM, and thus must be rounded prior to import. This can lead to variations in the numbers which are visible in the DataPack and those which are imported into DATIM. Negative numbers: In general, all numbers in the DataPack should be whole, positive integers. Non-numeric values: Any values which are not numeric, e.g. characters, is not allowed. Imbalanced PSNUxIM distribution: When distributing data from the main DataPack tabs, to the PSNUxIM tab, small varations due to rounding may result. As an example, if a target of 100 has been set in the main tab, and is then distributed evenly between three partners, each with a target value of 33, a value of 1 remains undistributed. To avoid this situation you may need to use allocation targets of 34%,34%,32% instead, which would ensure that the values allocated in the PSNUxIM tab match those in the main programmatic area tabs. Threaded comments: This type of comment, as opposed to the previous type of Notes used in Microsoft Excel, causes corruption issues when the app attempts to update your PSNUxIM tab. Prior to submitting for an updated PSNUxIM tab, you MUST remove all threaded comments. For more information about the differences between threaded comments and notes visit this link. Duplicated rows: There should be no duplicated rows in any of the main tabs or the PSNUxIM tab. Invalid organisation units: All PSNUs referened in the DataPack must exist in DATIM. Missing metadata: Certain columns such as the PSNU, Indicator code, Age, Sex and KeyPop columns must always be present. If any of these values is for some reason missing, please find the location of the error and fix the issue. 28.4 Validation rule checks Validation rules provide additional data quality controls between certain indicators. As a simple example, the number of persons testing positive for HIV should be less than or equal to the number of individuals tested. Under most circumstances, validation rules should not be violated, but there can be certain programmatic reasons why these violations should be waived. A number of rules have been created, and many of them are enforced in the DataPack itself. However, not all rules have been implemented in the DataPack, and due to formula changes and subtleties in how targets are allocated at the PSNUxIM level, additional review of the data in the PSNUxIM tab and main tabs may be required. During the validation of the datapack, all data contained in the PSNUxIM tab will be checked against all of the validation rules defined in DATIM. If there are any violations of the validation rules, the app will provide detailed feedback in regards to which PSNUxIM combination is affected. In order to resolve these, you will need to carefully review how the PNSUxIM allocations have been made to respective mechanisms in the PSNUxIM tab. While validation rule violations will not prevent the import of your data into DATIM, they may lead to data quality problems in both DATIM and downstream systems such as Panorama and PAW. If there are any validation rule issues, your PPM and DUIT can be requested to waive these at their discreation. 28.5 Analytics checks Analytics checks provide an additional type of data quality control. As an example, one analytics check looks for VMMC indeterminate rates greater than 5 percent. Ideally, the indeterminate rate should be a low as possible, but if for some reason targets have been set where the rate is greater than 5 %, the app will inform you about the specific PSNUxIM where this occurs. Again, these flags will not prevent the import of your data into DATIM, but are provided to help reviewers to make a determination regarding the approval of the DataPack for import. The app will provide a list of all analytics checks which have been flagged in the Analytics checks tab on the right side of the app pane. 28.6 Indicator summary This table provides a high-level SNU level summary of indicators from each of the main tabs of the DataPack. Note, that this data is NOT drawn from the PSNUxIM tab. This can be a useful first check of your DataPack, prior to the allocation of the data in the PSNUxIM tab. 28.7 SNUlevel summary This table listing provides all of the data from each of the main DataPack tabs summarized by the SNU level. 28.8 Validation rules This tab provides a listing of all validation rule violations, if any. The table provides the following fields PSNU: The specific PSNU where the violation occurs Mechanism: The specific mechanism where the violation occurs. Formula: The rule is specified with a left side, a right side, and an operator. The left and right side correspond to a data element (or data elements) located in the PSNUxIM tab. Using a combination of filters (PSNU, Mechanism and Data elemement), you should be able to locate the specific rows in the PSNUxIM tab which are leading to the validation rule violation. Diff (%) : Provides the percentage difference between the left and right side. Diff (Absolute) : Provides the numeric difference between the left and right side.
