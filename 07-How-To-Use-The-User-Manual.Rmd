# How to Use the User Manual

The DataPack consists of tabs that address indicators related to each
PEPFAR program area.

The COP22 DataPack User Manual reviews all indicators within each tab
and provides you with the relevant information to complete all required
sections of the DataPack correctly. It also instructs you where to find
more information on each program area in the COP21 Guidance.

## Key Column Highlights

> ***Column type?*** Indicates whether the data in this column is a
> result from a previous fiscal year ("Result"), an assumption that the
> country team is making ("Assumption"), a target for FY2023
> ("Targets"), or a reference for the country team as they fill out the
> DataPack ("Reference").
>
> ***What type of data?*** Indicates whether the data in the column is
> an integer, e.g., a whole number, or a percentage.
>
> ***Prepopulated data?*** Indicates whether the data in this column is
> prepopulated from data in DATIM or from data elsewhere in the
> DataPack.
>
> ***Enter or modify data?*** Indicates whether the user should enter
> new information into this column or is allowed to modify the
> prepopulated information in the column. If there is a question mark
> here, country teams must consult with their PPMs and Chairs before
> modifying the data in this column. If there is an exclamation mark
> here, country teams may overwrite the formula in this column, however
> it will prevent the DataPack from refreshing this data if changes are
> made elsewhere.
>
> ***Calculated column?*** This indicates that a formula is used to
> indicate where a formula is used to calculate the values in this
> column from data elsewhere in the DataPack.
>
> ***Linked column?*** This indicates that this data is either
> prepopulated by or is used to prepopulate data in a column on another
> tab within the DataPack. For columns that are prepopulated from
> another tab, clicking on the hyperlinked column name in the DataPack
> will take you to the referenced column.
>
> ***UID in Appendix**.* The UID provided here is a DataPack reference
> ID and can be used to find more information about the data entered
> into this column in the appendices.
