# PRIORITIZATION

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **SNU Prioritization (FY24)** $IMPATT.PRIORITY\_SNU.T$

### Instructions

**Important notes on Prioritization levels**

-   *Attained SNUs*: Geographic areas that have achieved ${\geq 90}$% (95 x 95)
    ART coverage in both males and females within the following age
    bands: \<01, 1-9, 10-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-49, 50+. Getting to \>90%
    ART coverage by both males and females within the target setting age
    bands at sub-national levels will ensure that the country gets to
    95/95/95 overall.

-   *Scale-up: Saturation and Aggressive Scale-Up SNUs*: Geographic
    areas with the highest HIV prevalence and disease burden nationally that have not yet
    achieved 95/95/95, particularly among the population groups
    experiencing the greatest burden of disease.
    -   *Scale-Up: Saturation* SNUs receive intensive PEPFAR support with a
        target of reaching 95/95/95 at all ages, gender and risk groups,
        PLHIV on ART by 2024 or 2025.
    -   *Scale-Up: Aggressive* SNUs receive intensive PEPFAR support with an
        overall goal of an increased rate of 'new on ART,' but are not
        expected to reach 95/95/95 by 2024 or 2025.

-   *Sustained SNUs*: Sustained SNUs receive a package of services
    provided by PEPFAR that are different in each country and include
    passive enrollment via HIV testing and counseling on request or as
    indicated by clinical symptomology, care and treatment services for
    PLHIV, and essential laboratory services for PLHIV.

-   *Central Support SNUs*: In Central Support SNUs, site-specific
    activities have transitioned to government or other support. Central
    Support Districts will continue to receive PEPFAR national support
    for overarching activities, such as quality assurance and quality
    improvement (QA/QI) to ensure that patients continue to receive
    quality services.

-   *For Countries that raised their PSNU level*: The OU should use the
    definitions above to determine their prioritization level at their
    new future PSNU level (e.g., the one they are using for
    COP23-FY24-FY25). However, they should not expand their intensity of
    site level support beyond their prior PSNU level support areas
    (e.g., the one they are using for COP22-FY23 and before), without
    explicit Chair approval, and concurrence from S/GAC/PRIME. Additionally, any future PSNUs that contain
    Scale-Up or Attained prior PSNUs, should likely be categorized into
    one of those groups. So for example, if Zone A contains Regions 1
    (Attained), 2 (Scale-Up Aggressive), 3 (Central Support), and 4
    (Sustained). Zone A should be categorized based on ART coverage as
    Attained, Scale-Up: Saturation or Scale-Up: Aggressive. But that
    does not mean that site-level support should automatically be
    extended to facilities in Region 3 or 4 of Zone A, unless there is
    explicit discussion with with Chair, PPM and DUIT Liaison, and concurrence of Chair and S/GAC/PRIME.
-   *Sustained SNUs*: Sustained SNUs receive a package of services
    provided by PEPFAR that are different in each country and include
    passive enrollment via HIV testing and counseling on request or as
    indicated by clinical symptomology, care and treatment services for
    PLHIV, and essential laboratory services for PLHIV.

-   *Central Support SNUs*: In Central Support SNUs, site-specific
    activities have transitioned to government or other support. Central
    Support Districts will continue to receive PEPFAR national support
    for overarching activities, such as quality assurance and quality
    improvement (QA/QI) to ensure that patients continue to receive
    quality services.

-   *For Countries that raised their PSNU level*: The OU should use the
    definitions above to determine their prioritization level at their
    new future PSNU level (e.g., the one they are using for
    COP24-FY25-FY26). However, they should not expand their intensity of
    site level support beyond their prior PSNU level support areas
    (e.g., the one they are using for COP23-FY24 and before), without
    explicit Chair approval. Additionally, any future PSNUs that contain
    Scale-Up or Attained prior PSNUs, should likely be categorized into
    one of those groups. So for example, if Zone A contains Regions 1
    (Attained), 2 (Scale-Up Aggressive), 3 (Central Support), and 4
    (Sustained). Zone A should be categorized based on ART coverage as
    Attained, Scale-Up: Saturation or Scale-Up: Aggressive. But that
    does not mean that site-level support should automatically be
    extended to facilities in Region 3 or 4 of Zone A, unless there is
    explicit discussion with and concurrence of Chair.

1.  Review the column "SNU Prioritization (FY24)" which will indicate
    prioritization levels set in COP23 for each PSNU.

2.  Review "SNU Prioritization (FY24)" and adjust as appropriate for
    COP23 programming. This is currently set to populate with the same
    level of prioritization that was referenced in step 1. Overwrite
    this column to set new levels of prioritization based on the list
    below. This column should only be populated using integers 1-8 and
    "M", "NA", or "Not a PSNU", as follows:

    -   1 = "Scale-up: Saturation"

    -   2 = "Scale-up: Aggressive"

    -   4 = "Sustained"

    -   5 = "Centrally Supported"

    -   6 = "Sustained: Commodities"

    -   7 = "Attained"

    -   8 = "Not PEPFAR Supported"

    -   "M" = "Military"

    -   "NA","Not a PSNU" = "INVALID"

3.  Review the column "FY24 SNU Prioritization Translation" to ensure
    the prioritization level for each PSNU is correct. To make any
    changes, only edit the column "SNU Prioritization (FY24)" from Step
